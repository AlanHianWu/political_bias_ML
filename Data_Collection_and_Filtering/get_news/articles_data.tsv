"January 5, 2021

The FBI and ATF are offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the location, arrest, and conviction of the person(s) responsible for the placement of pipe bombs in Washington, D.C., on January 5, 2021.

Details:

The FBI has developed new information regarding the pipe bombs discovered in Washington, D.C.

Between the hours of 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 5, 2021, an unknown individual placed two pipe bombs in Washington, D.C. One pipe bomb was placed at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee (RNC), located at 310 First Street Southeast, and the other was placed at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), located at 430 South Capitol Street Southeast #3.

The unknown individual wore a face mask, a grey hooded sweatshirt, and Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes in yellow, black, and gray. The individual carried a backpack in their hand."	-15.18

"Federal investigators are increasing the public reward for information that leads to the ""location, arrest & conviction of the person(s) responsible for the pipe bombs found in DC on Jan. 6""

The reward, originally set at $50,000 one day after the pipe bombs were first discovered, is now $75,000, according to a tweet published Thursday by the FBI's Washington Field Office.

ADDITIONAL REWARD: @ATFWashington & #FBIWFO are now offering a reward of up to $75K for info about the person(s) responsible for the placement of suspected pipe bombs in DC on January 6th.

According to the notice, both the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are searching for at least one suspect who is responsible for placing suspected pipe bombs in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6.

Between 1:00 and 1:15 p.m. on that date, law enforcement agencies received reports of two suspected pipe bombs, the notice said.

The two improvised explosive devices, which were defused by experts and did not detonate, were found outside the headquarters of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee during the mayhem of the riot at the U.S. Capitol Building."	-15.18
"(CNN) Two pipe bombs near the Democratic and Republican party headquarters discovered on January 6 were planted the night before the insurrection at the Capitol, the FBI said Friday.

Federal authorities again increased the reward for information about the pipe bomber and released new details and photos of a suspect on Friday, underscoring the urgency the Justice Department is treating this angle of the investigation, which remains one of the most troubling mysteries for law enforcement.

A new wanted poster says the bombs were placed between 7:30 and 8:30 p.m. on January 5, the night before the insurrection.

The FBI also identified the suspect's shoes as Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes in yellow, black, and gray, and included enhanced photos of them, along with photos of the devices.

The reward for information leading to the location, arrest, and conviction of the person or people responsible for placing the bomb is now $100,000. The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had already increased the reward once -- to $75,000 -- earlier this month.

"As it readies a reduced lineup and some ambitious physical events around the country, Sundance is ready to explain how the unusual edition will take place.

Like most events scheduled in the midst of the pandemic, January’s Sundance Film Festival will not look like its usual self. For months, America’s most prominent gathering of the film community indicated plans for a mostly online affair, with some drive-in screenings and events at arthouses around the country. The festival reduced its timeline to seven days from the usual 11, and will take place January 28 through February 3.

Now, less than two weeks before it unveils its lineup, Sundance announced specifics about the form it will take and how it will reach audiences.

The entire program will be available on festival.sundance.org to passholders and ticket buyers across the United States, in addition to some international territories that have yet to be finalized. The festival is also planning at least one physical screening for each film in its lineup, as well as drive-in options in Los Angeles and Park City. More than 25 arthouses around the country, from Alabama to Puerto Rico, will partner with Sundance for screenings and events. Its full slate of talks, as well as the New Frontier, XR, and emerging media programs, will be available around the world.

“Slippers instead of snow boots” is how new Sundance director Tabitha Jackson described the experience of the 2021 edition for most festivalgoers, since they will be swapping the cold hustle of a Utah mountain town for experiencing the festival at home.

The program will be accessible through a custom-built virtual platform, with screenings that use the Shift72 player that’s become an industry standard for virtual film festivals. “This whole festival feels like a prototype of some kind,” Jackson said. “It’s a grand experiment.”

Programmers are finalizing a lineup of 70-plus features, 50 short films, and four episodic works. Passholders will either gain immediate access or need to request space in advance, depending on the level of their accreditation. A three-hour availability window begins at each film’s scheduled start time. Two days after their premieres, all films will have a second screening window, this one for 24 hours.

“You’ve got to make a schedule and work your way through it,” Jackson said. “Because you’re not running between venues, the possibility of seeing more films is higher.”

The lineup marks a significant decrease from the 118 titles in the 2020 lineup, but a festival representative (correctly) described the reduced figure as proportional when reducing the 11-day festival to seven. Jackson said the decision is a matter of bandwidth. “Having a team for 70-plus live Q&As is a lot,” she said. “And since we’ve also committed to give every film a safe in-person commitment, that’s a big resource commitment.”

That did not make programming any easier, she said. The 2020 edition received 14,200 entries, and Jackson said that 2021 submission figures were consistent with previous years. “At the beginning of this whole process, the programming team genuinely didn’t know if it would be feast or famine,” she said. “Lo and behold, our figures are pretty similar than they normally are, and we are making harder decisions. There were tears shed this year about films we could not take.”

Some aspects remain unchanged. The schedule will adhere to Mountain Standard Time, starting with online opening events at 6 p.m. on the first night and several Day One films screening at once. From there, roughly five films will premiere per day, beginning at 10 a.m. Around three films will screen in the morning, and additional slots will be allocated between 1 p.m. and 10 p.m. That rhythm will taper off by Monday and the festival will culminate with a live awards ceremony broadcast on Wednesday. “We are trying things to preserve the energy of the festival with the online platform,” Jackson said.

Of course, some aspects of Sundance simply don’t translate to the online realm, including the organic social experience of waiting in line for movies, being crowded on buses, and fighting for space at an afterparty bar. Nevertheless, Jackson said her team aimed to replicate that with a virtual waiting room with a chat function. “You can bump into someone in the waiting room,” Jackson said, “without freezing your ass off.”

Though Sundance attendance can be a privileged experience in the best of times, many in the film community depend on attending it at the start of each year, and some have expressed concerns about maintaining the same level of access they would have under normal circumstances. As with previous editions, press access will be divided into two tiers, while industry attendees can purchase either an all-access industry pass for $2,500 or a standard industry pass for $500.

Jackson declined to offer specifics on virtual-screening capacities, but said that it would be larger than the real-world versions. “We’ve been talking to every film team individually, and what we’ve come up is that you’re more likely to be able to get into films this year than you would on the matter because our capacity is bigger,” she said.

She added that while attendees with higher-tier badges will have an easier job gaining access, the capacity limits for virtual screenings would allow any attendees who sign up early enough to explore the lineup the same way they would in person. “We’re confident that people can get into stuff,” she said. “It’s what the artists want — the industry to see their films. The business of getting the films on a distribution path to audiences is really key.”

Jackson said the festival would lean into its marketplace impact. “There are lots of films for sale this year, lots of new voices,” she said. “We are doubling down on the mission to be a discovery festival.”

Sundance benefited from watching other prominent festivals experiment with virtual and in-person events, including New York Film Festival and TIFF. Last month, NYFF reported a record-high 70,000 viewers across 50 states. Sundance is banking on a similar expansion in viewership. “The form of the festival is a necessary response to the moment informed by our values, but it’s also a platform that can really expand the reach of this independent community of artists,” Jackson said.

The general public also will be able to purchase tickets for virtual screenings, though the festival has yet to determine a timeline for making them available. “The slippers-instead-of-snow-boots thing is a nice way of thinking about how you can buy a single ticket to a film you want to see and that can be your first Sundance,” Jackson said. “And if you don’t have the funds to do those things, all our talks and events will be free and globally accessible, as long as you’ve got an internet connection.”

Sundance has assembled a list of theatrical venues that it will collaborate with around the country, though it remains unclear how each one will pull off its physical events. “This does feel like the right-sized group for us to work with in a meaningful way,” Jackson said. “They’ve doing all been kind of innovation across the summer. Some of them are ready to go live outdoors or with drive-ins. Others — if public health allows — are able to go indoors, but that’s a big ‘if.'”

Confirmed drive-in events will take place at the Rose Bowl and the Mission Tiki in Los Angeles. In Park City, The Ray will host indoor, socially distant screenings. The festival is also exploring around 15 international partners for screening events. “When you just look down that list of places that will be gathering during a strange painful time and a divided country, with a new administration coming in, it’s important to have them all,” Jackson said.

The usual chaos of Park City’s Main Street, where overnight breakout stars and filmmakers slide down the icy pavement alongside industry insiders, will go dormant. The festival’s online hub, however, will include “Main Street,” “Artists Lounge,” and “Festival Village” sections for social engagement. “I want to be able to capture some of the craziness that will be going on this year in the safety and privacy of people’s homes,” Jackson said.

With vaccines on the horizon, Sundance views its 2021 edition as a temporary setup, but Jackson acknowledged some tweaks might stick around. “I’m very attracted to the collaborative nature with different communities across the country and beyond, if possible,” she said. “We’re part of an ecosystem and if any part of that is weakened, then so are we. So how do we work together to get this work made, the artists paid, and the culture reflective of the independent community?”

The festival director will remains at home with family in Connecticut, but said she hoped to make it to Los Angeles in the coming weeks, followed by a potential road trip to Park City. “I’m trying to figure it out,” she said. “There’s something in my soul that wouldn’t feel right if I didn’t show my face there.”

"Filmmaker Siân Heder tipped me off about Marlee Matlin, saying that the moment you meet her, she’ll ask 10 questions. Sure enough, when we connect via Zoom, she takes one look at the bookcases in the background and begins, asking through her sign language interpreter and confidante Jack Jason if I’ve read every book on those shelves.

Noticing the Oscar in the background of her shot, I counter by asking Matlin if she frames all her video interviews just so, to spotlight the Academy Award and, yes, the Golden Globe (the Oscar’s “little cousin,” as she puts it) she won at age 21 for “Children of a Lesser God.”

Matlin’s Oscar placement, it turns out, can be strategic. Matlin works with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, advocating for the use of subtitles and captions on for-your-consideration screeners (a rule requiring them was finally passed this year) and advising on the long-delayed Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. During a recent meeting about the museum, talk turned to a room devoted to special moments in Oscar history, like when Hattie McDaniel became the first Black person to win. Several other historic firsts were cited, but there was no mention of Matlin being the first (and only) deaf performer to earn an Academy Award.

Matlin waited for a lull in the conversation and then grabbed her Oscar, asking, “Well, what was this for?”

“You should have seen everyone’s faces in the Zoom meeting,” Jason says, laughing.

“I did it with a sense of humor,” Matlin says. “At the same time, there was a little, ‘Hellooooo, don’t forget.’”

In one sense, Matlin’s long career as an actor and an activist has been a continuous run of her rolling up her sleeves, making some noise and telling Hollywood not to forget. And as Heder notes, that advocacy has come at something of a cost.

“She’s just this huge talent, an Oscar winner, but her opportunities have been limited because she’s been in countless situations where she has been asked to consult on a role or to teach a hearing actress about deaf culture,” Heder says. “She’s the most famous face within the deaf community, so she ends up being a spokesperson for a lot of the issues that the community is facing.”

Matlin’s latest movie, “CODA,” serves as both a showcase for her talent and yet another example of her determination to tell organically authentic stories about the lives of human beings who happen to be deaf. It premieres Thursday on the opening day of this year’s virtual Sundance Film Festival, weighing in as a crowd-pleaser that should be one of the hottest acquisition titles at the event.

Written and directed by Heder, “CODA” (child of deaf adults) follows Ruby (Emilia Jones), the only hearing member of a deaf family who, at 17, dreams of going away to college and pursuing her passion for singing. But she’s torn. Her family runs a fishing business and depends on Ruby to navigate the world outside the home.

All of the deaf characters — Ruby’s father, Frank (Troy Kotsur); mother, Jackie (Matlin); and brother, Leo (Daniel Durant) — are portrayed by deaf actors, and American Sign Language is subtitled, rather than translated, highlighting its vibrancy as a form of communication.

Matlin was the first actor to join “CODA” and stuck with Heder through a development process that had financiers balking at casting deaf actors in lead roles. Finally, Matlin issued an ultimatum: Hire deaf actors or I’m out.

“For the first time in a long time ... in fact, for the first time since my first film (‘Children of a Lesser God’), I felt that audiences would really see deaf people in a film,” Matlin says of her “obsession” with getting “Coda” made. “There are so many levels for people to identify with and, for people with no connection, who have never met a deaf person, to see sign language, to see deaf people in normal, day-to-day settings. ... People think that deaf people are monolithic in terms of how they approach life. And this film bursts that myth.”

“But to burst that myth,” Matlin continues, “it had to be told as authentically as possible. And it’s strange because studios clearly have the ability to greenlight a film and cast whomever they want, and there continues to be a lack of awareness that you can tell universal stories with deaf characters.”

The deaf characters in “CODA” are played by deaf actors, including Daniel Durant, second from left, Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur. (Sundance)

Matlin’s first scene in “CODA” takes place in a doctor’s office. Frank emphatically signs a series of symptoms. The diagnosis? Jock itch. The physician, through Ruby, tells them they have to abstain from sex for two weeks. Their reply: “Impossible.” “Can’t do it.” It’s an introduction to a couple who still find each other irresistible after decades together, an attraction that, of course, mortifies their teenage daughter. (Ruby initially translates the doctor’s diagnosis as they “can never, ever have sex again.”)

Jackie’s brio, Heder says, might run counter to the public perception of Matlin, which, thanks to all those years playing pollster Joey Lucas on “The West Wing,” is “very put together and classy.” Matlin herself disabuses you of that image almost immediately, swearing and telling dirty stories. “A total ballbuster,” Heder says, laughing, “and just hilarious.”

Matlin has been married for 27 years, meeting her husband, Kevin Grandalski, when he was a Burbank police officer monitoring traffic for her television show “Reasonable Doubts.” Matlin loves sharing the story of that first encounter.

“I became friends with a lot of cops, and one day I got to work and saw my friend in uniform and I went up and gave him a big hug and he stiffened up and I realized it was the wrong cop ... because of course they all look the same with their moustaches,” Matlin says. “And my friend sees this and goes, ‘Stay away from him.’ ‘No, no. You think I’m going to listen to you?’ And the rest is history.”

The couple have four children — two boys, two girls — 25 to 17. None is deaf (and neither is her husband), but, unlike, Jackie, Matlin has no hang-ups with raising hearing children — other than the usual frustrations that every parent of adolescents and young adults faces.

“The kids like to talk to dad about whatever’s going on in school because I think they feel like, if they talked to me, there’s a different energy in sign language,” Matlin says. “And it also probably has to do with the fact that I’m their mom and they’d rather go to dad than talk to mom.” Matlin laughs. “Or sometimes, I’m like, ‘Wait a minute. Is it because I’m failing as a mom because I’m not encouraging you to share with me.’ I don’t know. Everyone feels that way as a parent. But at the same time, I always want to make sure they don’t treat me any different in the household.”

Marlee Matlin won an Oscar for her film debut in “Children of a Lesser God,” and remains the only deaf performer to win an acting Oscar. (Myung J. Chun/Los Angeles Times)

Matlin moved to Los Angeles from New York not long after winning the Oscar. She was escaping a relationship with her “Children of a Lesser God” co-star William Hurt, who, she alleges in her 2010 memoir “I’ll Scream Later,” physically and mentally abused her. Before arriving, she called Henry Winkler and asked if she could crash at his Toluca Lake home for the weekend. Matlin met Winkler when she was 12 at a play at Chicago’s International Center on Deafness and the Arts. He encouraged her to follow her heart and pursue acting, and they kept in touch.

“So I showed up with the Oscar in my hand and he smiled, and he and his wife, Stacey, took me in,” Matlin remembers. “He said, ‘Let’s think it over for the weekend.’ And I ended up two years later still being there for the weekend.”

Matlin’s career had stalled after “Children of a Lesser God,” and she was plagued with self-doubt. She couldn’t forget the words of film critic Rex Reed who said she had won the Oscar only out of a pity vote and that giving it to her was a waste because there aren’t many (if any) roles for a “deaf mute” to perform.

“That stupid, f—ing ...,” Matlin says. “Clearly authenticity wasn’t in his vocabulary.”

More than three decades later, Matlin is still here, having fashioned a singular film and television career. And now, with “CODA,” she believes she has the perfect bookend to go with her film debut.

“I haven’t been this excited about a movie for so long,” Matlin says. “I hope that it will create a tidal wave.”"	-15.18
"Johnson & Johnson has unveiled some highly-anticipated data on its single-shot COVID-19 vaccine.

The company on Friday announced its vaccine candidate in a global trial was found to overall be 66 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19, but 85 percent effective at preventing severe disease. In the United States, the company said the level of protection against moderate to severe illness was 72 percent, but in Latin America, it was 66 percent effective. It was also 57 percent effective in South Africa, where most of the COVID-19 cases were from the B.1.351 variant.

Johnson & Johnson's data had been particularly anticipated because, unlike the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that have been approved in the United States, this candidate only requires one shot. The overall 66 percent efficacy rate wasn't as high as with either of those vaccines, which were each found to be about 95 percent effective, but that's still above the 50 percent level the FDA requires.

University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health vaccine expert Jonathan Temte also told The Washington Post the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could still be a ""game changer,"" especially since it can be stored at refrigerator temperature.

""Back in July and August, I was hoping we would see a vaccine that was 60 percent effective — in my mind, that would be great,"" Temte told the Post. ""And now we have had two that have hit the ball out of the park and set expectations spectacularly high, and that's not fair because we don't need a home run all the times we're up to bat.""

Johnson & Johnson also noted that in the the trial, the vaccine provided ""complete protection against COVID-related hospitalization and death."" The company plans to file with the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization within a week, The Associated Press reports, and it says it ""expects to have product available to ship immediately following authorization.""

"Cicely Tyson's final interview was a fitting tribute to her legendary impact on pop culture.

Recorded on Wednesday — hours before her death Thursday at age 96 — the Hollywood icon and trailblazer's last talk show appearance on Friday's Live with Kelly and Ryan featured a touching discussion about Tyson's life, career, and her recently published memoir, Just As I Am.

Tyson began the interview with a story about a stranger predicting her future success when she was a baby. ""This woman stopped [my mother] and started playing with me, and turned to my mother and said: 'Take care of this child. She has a sixth sense. She's going to make you very proud one day. She will take care of you in your old age.'""

She went on to tell hosts Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest about her pervasive shyness as a child, which she speculated led to her becoming such an observant person and, therefore, an accomplished actress who was able to naturally absorb characters. One such character, Rebecca in the 1972 film Sounder, scored Tyson her first competitive Oscar nomination in a stroke of fate.

""I never thought that I would be nominated for an Oscar. Never. But, I used to view the event every year. One night, I watched it and I said, 'I am going to sit in that front row one day.' And I certainly ended up doing that,"" Tyson said, explaining that the role came to her after a friend, Gloria Foster, passed on the role because they didn't offer her enough money. ""In the meantime, however, I started working on the role of Rebecca.... finally my manager, Larry, came to me and said, 'Well, someone else got the role. She turned it down.' I said, 'Because it doesn't belong to her; it belongs to me.""

Tyson would go on to receive an honorary Oscar in 2019 for her groundbreaking career in Hollywood that opened doors for Black performers, including notable turns in The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman on top of becoming the first Black woman to have a recurring role on a drama series in East Side/West Side.

""I'm devastated. My heart is just broken. I loved you so much!! You were everything to me!"" Tyson's How to Get Away with Murder costar, Viola Davis, wrote of the actress' passing in an Instagram post on Thursday. ""You made me feel loved and seen and valued in a world where there is still a cloak of invisibility for us dark chocolate girls. You gave me permission to dream....because it was only in my dreams that I could see the possibilities in myself.""

"Cicely Tyson, the award-winning actress whose long career was filled with memorable portrayals of strong and vibrant Black women, died Thursday. She was 96.

Tyson got her first major break at age 48, when she landed the role of a sharecropper's wife in Sounder, earning her critical acclaim and an Oscar nomination. She won two Emmys, including best lead actress in a drama, for her starring performance in the hit 1974 CBS TV movie The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, and she won a third Emmy in 1994 for her supporting role in the CBS TV movie Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All. She also earned Emmy nominations for playing the mother of LeVar Burton's Kunta Kinte in the famed 1977 TV miniseries Roots, Loretta Scott King in King, and other roles.

In 2013, at age 88, Tyson won a best leading actress Tony for The Trip to Bountiful. She was honored by the Kennedy Center in 2015 for a lifetime of boundary-breaking performances, awarded an honorary Oscar in 2018, and in 2016, President Barack Obama gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.

Tyson was born in New York City's Harlem neighborhood in 1924 to immigrants from the Caribbean island Nevis. After they divorced when she was 11, she lived with her mother, a strict and religious woman who frowned upon her decision, after high school, to pursue acting. ""My mother told me I could no longer live in her house because I was determined to be an actress,"" she said in a 1990 interview. ""I said 'okay,' and I moved out.""

Tyson was married to jazz legend Miles Davis from 1981 until 1988, and their relationship, which started in the 1960s, was by all accounts tumultuous. Davis is believed to have been her only husband. ""Emphatic that her work was all that mattered, Ms. Tyson shielded the details of her private life,"" The Washington Post reports. ""A list of survivors could not immediately be confirmed.""

After playing prostitutes early in her career, Tyson vowed to be more selective. ""I wait for roles — first, to be written for a woman, then, to be written for a Black woman,"" she told the Entertainment News Service in 1997. ""And then I have the audacity to be selective about the kinds of roles I play. I've really got three strikes against me. So, aren't you amazed I'm still here?"" Her memoir, Just As I Am, was published Tuesday. Peter Weber"	-15.18
"Cicely Tyson gave her last interview on 'Live with Kelly and Ryan.' Here's what she said

Show Caption Hide Caption Cicely Tyson, legendary Broadway, TV and film actress, dies at 96 Cicely Tyson made history as the first African-American woman to win a best lead actress Emmy for her role as Jane Pittman. staff video, USA TODAY

A day before her death, Cicely Tyson did a virtual interview on ""Live with Kelly and Ryan,"" where she talked about her childhood, how she snagged her leading role and her vegetarian lifestyle.

The actress and cherished icon, who was first Oscar-nominated for 1972's ""Sounder"" and 45 years later was honored with an honorary golden statuette for her body of work, died Thursday at age 96, her manager Larry Thompson confirmed to USA TODAY.

Her memoir, ""Just As I Am"" was released just two days before her she died.

In the interview, which aired Friday, Tyson described how she was initially turned away from the role as Rebecca in ""Sounder"" and how she landed it.

""They said, 'You're too young, you're too pretty, you're too sexy, you're too this, you're too that' and I said but I'm an actress,"" Tyson said.

The role of Rebecca was originally offered to actress Gloria Foster, but Foster declined in the negotiation stage.

Tyson recalled when her manager broke the news to her that Foster turned it down, Tyson replied ""because it doesn't belong to her.""

Tyson went on to make incredible impact in the entertainment industry.

Through her, Black women were represented roundly and robustly over seven decades on screens big and small. She trailblazed roles portraying the lives of women ranging from fictional slave-turned-activist Jane Pittman and educator Marva Collins to activist Coretta Scott King and abolitionist Harriet Tubman.

When describing her motivation behind pursuing certain roles, Tyson told Ripa and Seacrest that she never took jobs for the pay.

""I never really worked for money,” she said. ""I’ve worked because there were certain issues that I wish were addressed about myself and my race as a Black woman.""

And she did. It's difficult to convey just how deeply the actress permeated American culture through the decades. Tyson helped bring ""Roots"" to life in 1977 as Binta, Kunta Kinte’s mother; she stole the show in 1991's ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" gave weight to 2011's ""The Help"" and grounded modern TV series such as ""House of Cards"" and ""How to Get Away With Murder.""

Kelly and Ryan also celebrated Tyson for reaching her 96th birthday and asked about her nutritional regimen.

Tyson said she never drank or smoked and never did any drugs. However, there was one moment in history that turned her on the path to vegetarianism.

""When Martin Luther King was assassinated, I was so stunned by that, that I became a vegetarian and I've been that most of my life."" Tyson said.

Cicely Tyson, Emmy-Winning Actress and Industry Trailblazer, Dead at 96 -- HTGAWM's Viola Davis Shares Tribute TVLine Items: Interrogation Cancelled, Grey's Casts Following Vet and More

Less than 24 hours after the world learned of Cicely Tyson‘s death, the late actress appeared in a pre-taped interview during Friday’s episode of Live With Kelly and Ryan.

Tyson’s visit to the daytime talk show was in promotion of her new book Just as I Am: A Memoir, which hit shelves on Jan. 26.

The interview began with a story from the 96-year-old actress’ earliest days. When Tyson was just a baby, a stranger told her mother that she was going to grow up to be incredibly successful. Tyson explained that she was shy as a child (“I sucked this thumb for 12 years”), which made her a keen observer of humanity. “I listened and I learned why people said and did the things that they did.”

Looking back on her incredible career, Tyson said, “I never thought that I would be nominated for an Oscar, but I used to watch the event every year. One night, I watched it and I said, ‘I’m going to sit in that front row one day.’ And I ended up doing that for the role of Rebecca in Sounder,” a role she was originally considered “too young” and “too sexy” to play. The part was offered to another actress, who ultimately turned it down.

“I have been an actress my whole career who’s never been paid any money, because I never really worked for money,” she explained. “I’ve worked because there were certain issues that I wish were addressed about myself and my race as a Black woman.”

When asked for her health tips, she told the co-hosts, “I never smoked, I never drank and I never did drugs. When Martin Luther King was assassinated, I was so stunned by that that I became a vegetarian. And I’ve been one most of my life.”

“To say Cicely Tyson was an American legend would be too great an understatement,” Kelly Ripa said in a special message at the top of the hour. “We were honored to speak with her … and devastated to learn of her passing. She was a trailblazer who broke barriers for Black actresses and women everywhere. Cicely was a portrait of courage, dignity and grace. We feel very fortunate to share with you her last interview.”

The Live team released the following statement on Thursday evening: “Yesterday, Kelly and Ryan were honored to have the chance to interview the iconic Cicely Tyson, for a pre-taped show airing tomorrow, Friday, Jan. 29. Tonight the Live with Kelly and Ryan team was devastated to learn of her passing. They have decided to proceed and air the show and interview as originally scheduled. The hosts, staff and crew of “Live” send their deepest condolences to the family, friends and fans of Miss Tyson, and hope that the interview serves as a fitting tribute to this legendary actress.”

From a Kennedy Center honor to the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Tyson earned countless accolades throughout her incredible, decades-long career as a trailblazing actress. Her trophy case also includes three Primetime Emmys, a Tony, a Peabody and an Academy Award. She was 96 years old.

"Kelly Ripa Pays Tribute to Cicely Tyson Ahead of Posthumous Interview

In one of her last appearances before she died, Tyson joined the hosts of 'Live With Kelly and Ryan' to promote her recently published memoir 'Just As I Am.'

Just days after the release of her memoir Just As I Am, Cicely Tyson died at 96, following a long life of achievement in Hollywood.

In one of her last public appearances before she died, the late actress sat down for an interview on Live With Kelly and Ryan. The interview was taped on Wednesday for a planned Friday airing and after Tyson died, Live chose to proceed with airing the interview, albeit with a few onscreen notes about when the segment was recorded and a new video tribute from host Kelly Ripa at the top of the show.

“To say Cicely Tyson was an American legend would be too great an understatement,” a somber Ripa, wearing black, said via video before the pre-taped episode began. “We were honored to speak with her and devastated to learn of her passing. She was a trailblazer who broke barriers for Black actresses and women everywhere. Cicely was a portrait of courage, dignity and grace. We feel very fortunate to share with you her last interview.”

In the interview, Tyson shared tales from her childhood, growing up in New York City. When the legendary actress was just a baby, a stranger stopped her mother, telling her that Tyson was going to be very successful one day, and that she had a “sixth sense.”

And despite her prolific acting career, Tyson revealed that she was a very shy child. “I was an observer,” Tyson said. “I listened and I learned why people said and did the things that they did.”

Tyson’s long list of accolades includes three Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, a Peabody and a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Prior to being nominated for an Oscar for her first lead role, Tyson revealed that she “never thought that [she] would be nominated for an Oscar.”

“I used to watch the event every year,” she remembered. “One night, I watched it and I said, ‘I’m going to sit in that front row one day.’ And I ended up doing that for the role of Rebecca in Sounder.”

But Tyson almost didn’t get cast in the role, as the filmmakers originally believed her to be “too pretty,” “too young,” and “too sexy” to play the role. When they pursued another actress, Tyson didn't give up.

“It [didn’t] belong to her, it [belonged] to me,” she said of the role.

Tyson continued: “I had been an actress my whole career who’s never been paid any money, because I never really worked for money. I worked because there were certain issues that I wished were addressed about myself and my race as a Black woman.”

Ripa and Ryan Seacrest even asked Tyson about staying healthy, in an eerie coincidence, and the actress said she never smoked, drank or did drugs.

“When Martin Luther King was assassinated, I was so stunned by that that I became a vegetarian, and I’ve been that most of my life,” she said.

As Tyson’s interview came to a close, Ripa and Seacrest expressed their love and thanks to their guest.

“Everybody crying,” Ripa said. “You’ve made our producers cry because they are so moved to know that you are watching our little show. We appreciate it more than we can say.”"	-15.18
"U.S. officials are scrambling to learn the extent of a potentially massive cyberespionage campaign that infiltrated at least the Treasury and Commerce departments, but they believe they know how the suspected Russian government hackers broke in. The cybersecurity firm FireEye, which disclosed last week that it has been hacked, said late Sunday it has determined the monthlong ""global campaign"" had been perpetrated via malware inserted in the security update of SolarWinds' popular Orion server management software.

SolarWinds, based in Austin, says its 300,000 customers include the White House, all five branches of the U.S. military, the Pentagon, the State Department, the Justice Department, the National Security Agency, NASA, and the 10 top U.S. telecommunications firms and five leading accounting firms. It attributed the compromised software to a ""highly sophisticated, targeted, and manual supply chain attack by a nation state."" FireEye said the infected security update appears to have been released in the spring.

The Homeland Security Department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a rare directive late Sunday for ""all federal civilian agencies to review their networks for indicators of compromise and disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion products immediately."" The SolarWinds breach ""poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks,"" said acting CISA Director Brandon Wales, ""and we urge all our partners — in the public and private sectors — to assess their exposure to this compromise and to secure their networks against any exploitation.""

The number of targets was likely limited by the labor-intensive requirements of this particular hack, cybersecurity experts said. But the attack, believed to have been carried out by the APT29 or Cozy Bear arm of Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service, will still likely end up being extensive and damaging.

""This is looking very, very bad,"" one person familiar with the hack told The Washington Post. ""This can turn into one of the most impactful espionage campaigns on record,"" cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch told The Associated Press, noting that the Orion software grants remote, ""God-mode"" access to networks. Another person familiar with the breach told The Wall Street Journal it's a ""10"" out of 10 in terms of several and national security implications.

Russia's U.S. Embassy denied that Moscow was behind the attacks, calling the allegations ""unfounded attempts of the U.S. media to blame Russia."" Peter Weber"	-15.18
"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18

Johnson & Johnson’s long-awaited vaccine appears to protect against COVID-19 with just one shot – not as strong as some two-shot rivals but still potentially helpful for a world in dire need of more doses.

J&J said Friday that in the U.S. and seven other countries, the single-shot vaccine was 66% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe illness, and much more protective — 85% — against the most serious symptoms.

There was some geographic variation. The vaccine worked better in the U.S. — 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 – compared to 57% in South Africa, where it was up against an easier-to-spread mutated virus .

“Gambling on one dose was certainly worthwhile,” Dr. Mathai Mammen, global research chief for J&J’s Janssen Pharmaceutical unit, told The Associated Press.

With vaccinations off to a rocky start globally, experts had been counting on a one-dose vaccine that would stretch scarce supplies and avoid the logistics nightmare of getting people to return for boosters.

But with some other competing vaccines shown to be 95% effective after two doses, at question is whether somewhat less protection is an acceptable tradeoff to get more shots in arms quickly.

“Frankly, simple is beautiful,” said Dr. Matt Hepburn of Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government’s vaccine initiative.

The company said within a week, it will file an application for emergency use in the U.S., and then abroad. It expects to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. by June — and a billion doses globally by the end of the year. J&J wouldn’t say exactly how much could be ready to ship as soon as U.S. authorities give the green light.

These are preliminary findings from a study of 44,000 volunteers that isn’t completed yet. Researchers tracked illnesses starting 28 days after vaccination – about the time when, if participants were getting a two-dose variety instead, they would have needed another shot.

After day 28, no one who got vaccinated needed hospitalization or died regardless of whether they were exposed to “regular COVID or these particularly nasty variants,” Mammen said. When the vaccinated did become infected, they had a milder illness.

Defeating the scourge that has killed more than 2 million people worldwide will require vaccinating billions, and the shots being rolled out in different countries so far all require two doses a few weeks apart for full protection. Early data is mixed on exactly how well all the different kinds work, but shots made by Pfizer and Moderna appear to be about 95% protective after the second dose.

That makes for a dilemma: Wouldn’t people given a choice want a vaccine found to offer much more protection?

Full Coverage: Coronavirus vaccine

J&J’s Mammen said direct comparisons are difficult because the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines weren’t tested when the pandemic was so severe, with record levels of hospitalizations and deaths plus mutant versions of the virus sweeping some countries.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, called that a messaging challenge — because the priority is to protect people from hospitalization and death, which J&J’s vaccine appears to do. Especially in places where it’s hard to get people to return for their second dose, the one-dose version could play a key role.

Maybe more important is “a wake-up call” from the study that mutating viruses can challenge vaccines. And the best way to prevent more mutations is “by vaccinating as many people as you possibly can,” Fauci said.

All COVID-19 vaccines train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, usually by spotting the spikey protein that coats it. But they’re made in very different ways.

J&J’s shot uses a cold virus like a Trojan horse to carry the spike gene into the body, where cells make harmless copies of the protein to prime the immune system in case the real virus comes along. It’s the same technology the company used in making a successful Ebola vaccine.

Rival AstraZeneca makes a similar cold virus vaccine that requires two doses. Both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator, making them easier to ship and to use in developing countries than the frozen kind made by Pfizer and Moderna.

It’s not clear exactly how well the AstraZeneca version, being used in Britain and several other countries, works. Tests in Britain, South Africa and Brazil suggested two doses are about 70% effective although there are questions about how much protection older adults get. An ongoing U.S. study may provide more information.

J&J said its vaccine works consistently in a broad range of people: A third of participants were over age 60, and more than 40% had other illnesses putting them at risk of severe COVID-19, including obesity, diabetes and HIV.

J&J said the vaccine is safe, with reactions similar to other COVID-19 shots such as fever that occur when the immune system is revved up.

While it released few details, the company said there were no serious allergic reactions. But occasionally other COVID-19 vaccines trigger such reactions, which can be reversed if promptly treated – and authorities have warned people to be on the lookout regardless of which type of vaccine is used.

J&J had hedged its bets with a study of a two-dose version of its vaccine, which is still underway.

Friday’s interim results come on the heels of another vaccine in final testing. Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89% effective in a U.K. study and that it also seems to work — though not as well — against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa. A larger study in the U.S. and Mexico is still enrolling volunteers.

Wall Street appeared dissatisfied with J&J’s results, with shares dropping 4.2% in early trading, a rare big drop for the world’s biggest maker of health care products. Shares were down $4.07, or 2.4%, at $165.09 in mid-morning trading.

In contrast, tiny Novavax saw shares skyrocket, jumping 71% to $229.72 in mid-morning trading.

Vaccine Candidate 72% Effective in the US and 66% Effective Overall at Preventing Moderate to Severe COVID-19, 28 Days after Vaccination

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., January 29, 2021 – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today announced topline efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial, demonstrating that the investigational single-dose COVID-19 vaccine in development at its Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies met all primary and key secondary endpoints. The topline safety and efficacy data are based on 43,783 participants accruing 468 symptomatic cases of COVID-19.

The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate in protecting moderate to severe COVID-19, with co-primary endpoints of 14 days and 28 days following vaccination. Among all participants from different geographies and including those infected with an emerging viral variant, Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate was 66% effective overall in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19, 28 days after vaccination. The onset of protection was observed as early as day 14. The level of protection against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the United States, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa, 28 days post-vaccination.

“Johnson & Johnson embarked on the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic a year ago, and has brought the full force of our capabilities, as well as tremendous public-private partnerships, to enable the development of a single-shot vaccine. Our goal all along has been to create a simple, effective solution for the largest number of people possible, and to have maximum impact to help end the pandemic,” said Alex Gorsky, Chairman, Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “We’re proud to have reached this critical milestone and our commitment to address this global health crisis continues with urgency for everyone, everywhere.”

Prevention of severe disease; protection against COVID-related hospitalization and death

The vaccine candidate was 85 percent effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied, [i] 28 days after vaccination in all adults 18 years and older. Efficacy against severe disease increased over time with no cases in vaccinated participants reported after day 49.

The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated complete protection against COVID-related hospitalization and death, 28 days post-vaccination. There was a clear effect of the vaccine on COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), with no reported cases among participants who had received the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, 28 days post-vaccination.

“These topline results with a single-shot COVID-19 vaccine candidate represent a promising moment. The potential to significantly reduce the burden of severe disease, by providing an effective and well-tolerated vaccine with just one immunization, is a critical component of the global public health response,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “A one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings, enhancing access, distribution and compliance. Eighty-five percent efficacy in preventing severe COVID-19 disease and prevention of COVID-19-related medical interventions will potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of COVID-19. It also offers the hope of helping ease the huge burden placed on healthcare systems and communities.”

In the study, the definition of severe COVID-19 disease included laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and one or more of the following: signs consistent with severe systemic illness, admission to an intensive care unit, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure or death, among other factors. Moderate COVID-19 disease was defined as laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and one or more of the following: evidence of pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, shortness of breath or abnormal blood oxygen saturation above 93%, abnormal respiratory rate (≥20); or two or more systemic symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.

Protection was generally consistent across race, age groups, including adults over 60 years of age (N= 13,610), and across all variants and regions studied, including South Africa where nearly all cases of COVID-19 (95%) were due to infection with a SARS-CoV-2 variant from the B.1.351 lineage [ii] .

Multi-continent Study Provides Clinical Data on Multiple Emerging Viral Mutations

The ENSEMBLE study results include efficacy against newly emerging strains of coronavirus, including some highly infectious variants present in the US, Latin America and South Africa. The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial is being conducted at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in eight countries and three regions, at a time when disease spread has accelerated throughout the world resulting in people having increased exposure to the virus.

“These results are a testament to the extraordinary efforts of everyone involved in our COVID-19 vaccine candidate clinical program, and we are extremely grateful to the clinical trial staff and trial participants for their invaluable contributions,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development. “Changing the trajectory of the pandemic will require mass vaccination to create herd immunity, and a single-dose regimen with fast onset of protection and ease of delivery and storage provides a potential solution to reaching as many people as possible. The ability to avoid hospitalizations and deaths would change the game in combating the pandemic.”

Trial participants of the phase 3 ENSEMBLE study continue to be followed for up to two years for assessments of safety and efficacy. Therefore, these data may be updated based on ongoing analysis. The comprehensive available data set will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.

Phase 3 ENSEMBLE Study Safety Data

The analysis included a concurrent review of the available Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study safety data by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an independent group of experts, that did not report any significant safety concerns relating to the vaccine. A review of adverse events indicated that a single-dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate was generally well-tolerated.

The safety profile was consistent with other vaccine candidates using Janssen’s AdVac® technology among more than 200,000 people to date. Overall fever rates were 9% and Grade 3 fever 0.2%. Overall serious adverse events (SAEs) reported were higher in participants who received placebo as compared to the active vaccine candidate. No anaphylaxis was observed.

Janssen Vaccine Candidate Access and Distribution

The Company is committed to bringing an affordable COVID-19 vaccine on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use, pending regulatory authorizations.

In addition, the Janssen vaccine candidate is compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels. If authorized, Janssen’s single-dose vaccine candidate is estimated to remain stable for two years at -20°C (-4°F), at least three months of which can be at temperatures of 2-8°C (36°F–46°F). The Company will ship the vaccine using the same cold chain technologies it uses today to transport other innovative medicines.

The Company intends to file for U.S. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in early February and expects to have product available to ship immediately following authorization. It expects to share more information on specifics of deployment as authorizations are secured and contracts are finalized. The Company’s anticipated manufacturing timeline will enable it to meet its 2021 supply commitments, including those signed with governments and global organizations.



Phase 3 ENSEMBLE Study Design

The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single-dose vaccine versus placebo in adults 18 years old and older.

The ENSEMBLE study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Janssen vaccine candidate in protecting against both moderate and severe COVID-19 disease, with assessment of efficacy as of day 14 and as of day 28 as co-primary endpoints.

Phase 3 ENSEMBLE Study Demographics

The trial, conducted in eight countries across three continents, includes a diverse and broad population including 34% (N= 14,672) of participants over age 60.

The study enrolled 44% (N=19,302) of participants in the United States, 41% (N=17,905) in Central and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru) and 15% (N=6,576) in South Africa.

Forty-five percent of participants are female, 55% male.

Among participants globally, 59% are White/Caucasian; 45% are Hispanic and/or Latinx; 19% are Black/African American; 9% are Native American and 3% are Asian. In the United States, 74% are White/Caucasian; 15% are Hispanic and/or Latinx; 13% are Black/African American; 6% are Asian and 1% are Native American.

Forty-one percent of participants in the study had comorbidities associated with an increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19 (overall 41%), obesity (28.5%), type 2 diabetes (7.3%), hypertension (10.3%), HIV (2.8%); also other immunocompromised participants were in the study.

Janssen’s Vaccine Technology

The investigational Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate leverages the Company’s AdVac® vaccine platform , which was also used to develop and manufacture Janssen’s European Commission-approved Ebola vaccine regimen and construct its Zika, RSV, and HIV investigational vaccine candidates.

The Janssen AdVac® viral vector technology can induce potent and long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses, enabling the pursuit of vaccines for disease targets that are currently unpreventable or untreatable.

Johnson & Johnson continues to develop and test its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in accordance with ethical standards and sound scientific principles . The Company is committed to transparency and sharing information related to its ongoing clinical studies – including the ENSEMBLE study protocol .

ENSEMBLE has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under Contract No. HHSO100201700018C, and in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Janssen has worked with BARDA since 2015 on innovative solutions for influenza, chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear threats and emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola. In February 2020, Janssen and BARDA began work on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine based on Janssen’s AdVac® technology.

The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies entered into a collaboration with the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) to support the development of the preventive vaccine candidate for COVID-19.

Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine program has been designed to be thorough and driven by science. As such, the Company is also investigating immune responses for different doses and dosing regimens as well as studying a two-dose regimen of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate for efficacy in the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE 2 study.

"(CNN) Comedian and former ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart is finally on Twitter, and his first tweet was about the GameStop-Reddit mayhem on Wall Street.

"Robinhood should consider changing its name to the Sheriff of Nottingham.

The past two days have turned Wall Street on its head as Reddit users colluded to buy massive amounts of GameStop stock, with the explicit aim of hurting hedge funds that profit off shorting the typically falling stock. A lot of that GameStop trading happened on Robinhood, a free app that allows people to trade small amounts of stocks. But on Thursday, Robinhood decided to betray its name and halt purchases of GameStop stock, as well as stock from other nostalgic companies.

Robinhood said in a Thursday blog post that after ""recent volatility,"" it wasn't allowing the purchase of new stock from GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Bed Bath and Beyond, Koss headphones, and Nokia, as well as Naked Brands, which may have gotten caught up in the shutdown after a Wednesday direct offering campaign. Robinhood also raised margin requirements for some securities, meaning users have to front more of their own money to buy the securities, ostensibly benefiting those with more cash. TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab also increased margin requirements for GameStop stock on Wednesday.

Robinhood has framed the decision as a way to ""help our customers navigate this uncertainty"" in its blog post. The Verge meanwhile noted one hedge fund suffering amid the GameStop surge was Melvin Capital Management, which another hedge fund, Citadel, has since bailed out. Citadel's founder is Ken Griffin, who also founded Citadel Securities, a firm that partners with Robinhood to execute orders that also works with TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev later denied making the company's decision ""on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.""

While Robinhood's everyday users may be blocked from trading these newly booming stocks, they were able to exact revenge against the app with a wave of one-star Google app store reviews. Kathryn Krawczyk

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Online broker Robinhood restricted trade in about 13 highly volatile stocks such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment to protect the company and its customers, Chief Executive Vladimir Tenev said on Thursday.

The app, popular with young investors for its simplicity, has been at the heart of the day-trading mania that has followed calls on social media to buy stocks heavily shorted by hedge funds. The restrictions allowed customers to sell but not buy.

“We absolutely did not do this at the direction of any market maker or hedge fund ... the reason we did it is because Robinhood as a brokerage firm, we have lots of financial requirements,” Tenev said on CNBC.

“In order to protect the firm and protect our customers, we had to limit buying in these stocks,” he said, adding it was a “difficult decision”.

The company had earlier announced the restrictions, and raised margin requirements, in a blog post which said limited buying would be available on Friday. The move has drawn the ire of angry customers and even politicians.

“We understand our customers are upset, we’re doing what we can to re-enable buying in these names,” Tenev said.

“We want to be clear in the communications, and I own that we should have been out there a little bit sooner.”"	-15.18
"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18

"Everything you need to know about double-masking—and which ones to wear

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been recommending people wear face masks since early April. Because of the shortage of N95 masks, cloth face masks have become the norm, with many options available from homemade ones on Etsy to masks from large retailers, including our favorite the Athleta Non Medical Mask.

I’ve been evaluating many of these cloth options since they first hit the market. Before joining Reviewed, I spent most of my career in apparel and textiles. Most recently I was at Nike, where I evaluated the quality of materials and determined if they were fit for use for apparel products. I’m definitely a materials nerd. I’ve rigorously tested and worn dozens of masks, and evaluated them for quality, comfort and fit to find the best ones. And the need for cloth face masks has not gone away.

With the new COVID-19 variants appearing around the world, and little known about new strains, cloth masks are still being recommended to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. But are two masks more effective than one? With double-masking becoming more prominent—several people were wearing two masks at president Joe Biden’s inauguration—more people are asking if doubling up makes sense.

Here’s everything you need to know on how to find a quality mask, if two masks are better than one, and if wearing two masks is right for you.

How do I find a quality cloth mask?

Whether you wear one face mask or more, it should be a quality face mask. I’ve previously written about what to look for in a quality mask and some of the most important things to look for are multiple layers, tightly woven fabric, and a snug fit to the face. We love Athleta’s Everyday Non Medical Mask, which won an Editor’s Choice award for Best Overall. This mask strikes a nice balance between protection and breathability. It has triple-layered woven fabric, a bendable nose piece, and adjustable ear loops which help with a snug fit to the face.

Are two masks better than one?

According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wearing two masks is common sense. Fauci told NBC News’ TODAY “If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on, it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective.”

Studies have found that multiple layers of fabric in a mask increase filtration effectiveness from virus particles. Following that logic, By double-masking, a person increases the number of layers of fabric protecting their face, thereby upping the level of filtration.

From my years of working with fabrics, this concept makes sense. Woven fabric is essentially a mesh grid made of threads. The more these grids layer on top of each other, the more likely holes are covered, which then creates more areas for respiratory particles to get blocked or trapped before they make it to your face.

Looking for new masks? Here are Reviewed's favorites

Another advantage of donning two masks is that it helps with a snug fit. A peer-reviewed study in materials science journal Matter found that adding a “nylon overlay” to many masks minimized gaps, allowing for better filtration. Study author Dr. Loretta Fernandez, an associate professor at Northeastern University, told USA Today, “the second mask not only added an extra layer of protection but also made the mask fit snugger around the face.”

Should I wear two masks?

The CDC has not issued official guidance on double-masking, however, the evidence suggests two masks are likely more effective than a single mask. In situations where you are not able to social distance, you may want to double up by wearing a cloth mask over a surgical mask or two cloth masks.

In the early days of the pandemic, medical workers were double-masking to try to extend the life of scarce N95 masks, which continue to be in short supply.

One drawback of wearing two masks is that the multiple layers of material could make it harder to breathe. If you already have trouble breathing while wearing one mask, adding another may not be the best option. The CDC notes wearing one mask is better than not wearing any face covering.

"General Motors — the maker of the Hummer, the company that ""killed the electric car"" two decades ago — announced Thursday that it will phase out gas- and diesel-powered cars and trucks by 2035 and sell only zero-emission vehicles. Three-quarters of GM's carbon output comes from the tailpipes of the cars, trucks, and SUVs it sells, and going electric is the cornerstone of its other ambitious plan announced Thursday, to be a completely zero-emission company by 2040.

This is ""a seismic shift by one of the world's largest automakers that makes billions of dollars today from gas-guzzling pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles,"" The New York Times reports. But auto industry analysts said it's a smart bet. GM's shares rose more than 3.5 percent on the news.

""The future of mobility is electric. Tesla set the pace but others are getting into the game,"" Andrew Hoffman, professor of sustainable enterprise at University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, tells USA Today. ""Ford has notably made a serious play in electrics, VW had a false start. GM has to be in this to be viable going forward.""

GM and its CEO, Mary Barra, are hanging their strategy on a new Ultium battery GM is developing in-house and plans to manufacture in the Midwest and South. But the company also said its aspirations for an all-electric fleet within 15 years are tied in part to government incentives for consumers and charging infrastructure. President Biden this week directed the federal government to tighten fuel-economy standards and purchase only electric vehicles, and he's pushing spending legislation that aims to build half a million charging stations and offer rebates and other incentives for buying electric vehicles.

""'Aspire' is a great word because it helps us work toward our vision,"" said Dane Parker, GM's chief sustainability officer. ""We're taking action to have our vehicles be zero-emission by 2035. This is going to take the effort of a lot of people and a lot of governments to get there. So we have a vision, we have a plan, and we're taking action today to get there.""

GM plans to release its all-electric GMC Hummer truck this year, at a cost of about $113,000. Its only other significant electric vehicle in the U.S. market is the small Bolt. Peter Weber"	-15.18
"The days of the internal combustion engine are numbered.

General Motors said Thursday that it would phase out petroleum-powered cars and trucks and sell only vehicles that have zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a seismic shift by one of the world’s largest automakers that makes billions of dollars today from gas-guzzling pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.

The announcement is likely to put pressure on automakers around the world to make similar commitments. It could also embolden President Biden and other elected officials to push for even more aggressive policies to fight climate change. Leaders could point to G.M.’s decision as evidence that even big businesses have decided that it is time for the world to begin to transition away from fossil fuels that have powered the global economy for more than a century.

G.M.’s move is sure to roil the auto industry, which, between car and parts makers, employed about one million people in the United States in 2019, more than any other manufacturing sector by far. It will also have huge ramifications for the oil and gas sector, whose fortunes are closely tied to the internal combustion engine.

A rapid shift by the auto industry could lead to job losses and business failures in related areas. Electric cars don’t have transmissions or need oil changes, meaning conventional service stations will have to retool what they do. Electric vehicles also require fewer workers to make, putting traditional manufacturing jobs at risk. At the same time, the move to electric cars will spark a boom in areas like battery manufacturing, mining and charging stations."	-15.18

"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said Robinhood's move to stop trading in certain speculative names was in the best interest of the company and its millions of users.

""In order to protect the firm and protect our customers we had to limit buying in these stocks,"" Tenev told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin Thursday evening.

""Robinhood is a brokerage firm, we have lots of financial requirements. We have SEC net capital requirements and clearing house deposits. So that's money that we have to deposit at various clearing houses. Some of these requirements fluctuate quite a bit based on volatility in the market and they can be substantial in the current environment where there's a lot of volatility and a lot of concentrated activity in these names that have been going viral on social media,"" said Tenev.

Tenev denied there was any existing liquidity issue at the firm and said Robinhood had tapped credit lines as a proactive measure.

""We want to put ourselves in a position to allow our customers to be as unrestricted as possible in accordance with the requirements and the regulations,"" said Tenev. ""So we pulled those credit lines so that we could maximize within reason the funds we have to deposit at the clearing houses.""

Amid a wild week of speculative retail trading, Robinhood on Thursday restricted trading in thirteen equities, including GameStop and AMC Entertainment. The free stock trading pioneer only allowed clients to sell positions, not open new ones, in certain securities, raised margin requirements, and even said it would close out some positions automatically if the client was at risk of not having the necessary collateral.

""We just haven't see this level of concentrated interest market wide in a small number of names before,"" said Tenev. ""We do believe that you should be able to buy and sell the stocks that you want to.""

Robinhood then said after the closing bell Thursday that it would allow limited buying of restricted securities on Friday.

The broker's initial decision was met with outrage from its band of loyal retail investors; however, Robinhood explained that the move was made to comply with capital requirements mandated by the SEC for broker dealers.

""We have seen unprecedented interest due to the fact that finance has been culturally relevant in a way that hasn't been before,"" said Tenev. ""Of course Robinhood stands for everyday investors. From the very beginning we have stood for investors opening up access. It pains us to have had to impose these restrictions and we're going to do what we can to enable trading in these stocks as soon as we can.""

Tenev said Robin's decision was not at the direction of a market maker or hedge fund.

GameStop shares closed down 44% on Thursday after Robinhood restricted trading and then jumped around 119% to trade at $424 in premarket trading."	-15.18
"U.S. stocks fell sharply on Friday as heightened speculative trading by retail investors continued to unnerve the market.

The Dow Jones Industrial average lost 620 points, or 2%, after falling below the 30,000 mark at its session low. The 30-stock benchmark is on track to post its worst day since October. The S&P 500 fell 2.4% as all 11 sectors traded in the red. The Nasdaq Composite slid 2.6% as Apple dropped 4.7% and other major tech names slipped.

Shares of GameStop jumped more than 70% after Robinhood said it would allow limited buying of the stock and other heavily shorted names after restricting access the day before. Robinhood raised more than $1 billion from its existing investors overnight, in addition to tapping bank credit lines, to ensure it had the capital required to allow some trading again in volatile stocks like GameStop.

Investors are concerned that if GameStop continues to rise in such a volatile fashion, it may ripple through the financial markets, causing losses at brokers like Robinhood and forcing hedge funds who bet against the stock to sell other securities to raise cash.

There are also fears that the GameStop mania is a sign of a larger bubble in the market and that its unraveling could also cause turbulence and hit retail investors hard. A number of lawmakers also called for an investigation into the chaotic trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday it will look into regulated body's actions to uncover if the decisions made disadvantaged investors.

""There's way too much leverage in the system, and we're starting to see signs that this excess leverage is going to be unwound in a way that will create headwinds for the stock market and other risk assets for more than just a few days,"" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak.

Meanwhile, new trial results from Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine disappointed some investors, weighing on the broader market.



JNJ said its one-dose vaccine demonstrated 66% effectiveness overall in protecting against Covid-19. The vaccine was 72% effective in the United States, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa after four weeks, the company said. The vaccine however offered complete protection against Covid-related hospitalizations. Shares of JNJ dropped 3.6%.

Stocks had rallied to record highs on the hope that vaccines would be effective against Covid to allow a smooth economic reopening before the end of the year. New mutations more resilient to vaccines could upend that rosy outlook for investors.

It's been a volatile week on Wall Street. The Dow lost more than 600 points on Wednesday, suffering its worst sell-off in three months. Then the blue-chip benchmark rebounded by 300 points on Thursday amid a broad market rally. All three major averages have lost at least 1% this week.

The market also experienced the highest trading volume in years as the mania heated up. On Wednesday, total market volume hit more than 23.7 billion shares, surpassing the level during the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Thursday also saw extremely heavy trading with more than 19 billion shares changing hands."	-15.18
"Facebook's independent ""Supreme Court"" is out with its first rulings — and at least in this initial batch of cases, it has mostly sided against the company.

The Facebook Oversight Board, which will review appeals of Facebook's moderation decisions, on Thursday revealed its first five rulings, and in all but one case, the group decided to overturn Facebook's decisions, NBC News reports.

First, the board overturned Facebook's removal of a post that ""commented on the supposed lack of reaction to the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China"" because it ""did not reach the level of hate speech."" Next, it overturned the removal of photos that included uncovered nipples because they were allowed for raising breast cancer awareness.

It also overturned the removal of a post featuring an alleged Joseph Goebbels quote, with the board finding the post ""did not support the Nazi party's ideology."" Finally, the removal of a post that ""included claims that a cure for COVID-19 exists"" was overturned, as the board determined Facebook hadn't ""demonstrated the post would rise to the level of imminent harm."" The only one of the five cases in which the board actually upheld's Facebook's decision had to do with a hate speech case, in which the user posted a ""demeaning slur"" about Azerbaijanis.

This first set of decisions, which Facebook says are binding, is particularly significant because the board was recently handed by far its biggest case yet: the suspension of former President Donald Trump. The oversight board will decide in the coming weeks whether Facebook was right to suspend Trump in the wake of the deadly Capitol riot — and after these first rulings were revealed, NBC News' Dylan Byers wrote, ""If I'm Donald Trump, I'm cautiously optimistic about getting my Facebook account back right now."" Brendan Morrow"	-15.18
"Facebook's Oversight Board on Thursday issued its first round of decisions, overturning several decisions by the company to remove posts for violating policies on hate speech, violence and other issues.

The first-ever rulings, which Facebook has said it will abide by, come in the run-up to a far more consequential decision the board will make in the weeks ahead: Whether to overturn Facebook's decision to suspend former President Donald Trump's account in the wake of the Jan. 6 riots in Washington.

The board, a group of 20 journalists, politicians and judges from around the world, was formed last year and has been tasked with passing judgment on the social media giant's handling of the most difficult content issues. It claims total independence from Facebook, and Facebook has said that the decisions it makes will be binding.

Thursday's decisions offer a sign that the social media giant's newly formed ""Supreme Court"" intends to err on the side of free speech.

""For all board members, you start with the supremacy of free speech,"" Alan Rusbridger, one of the 20 board members and the former editor-in-chief of The Guardian, said in an interview before the decisions were made public. ""Then you look at each case and say, what's the cause in this particular case why free speech should be curtailed?""

Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president of content policy, said Thursday that the company “will implement these binding decisions in accordance with the bylaws and have already restored the content in three of the cases as mandated by the Oversight Board.”

The board's first rulings concerned five cases in which Facebook had removed posts for violating its policies. And in four out of the five cases reviewed, the board voted to overturn Facebook's original decisions. The board also called on Facebook to give users greater clarity over its policies and how it intends to enforce them.

Two of those rulings pertained to Facebook's policy on hate speech, one of which was overturned and the other upheld.

In the first case, Facebook had removed a post from a user in Myanmar who appeared to disparage Muslims as psychologically inferior. While the company decided that the post violated its policy, the board ruled that the terms used ""were not derogatory or violent.""

""While the post might be considered pejorative or offensive towards Muslims, it did not advocate hatred or intentionally incite any form of imminent harm,"" the board wrote.

In the second case, a user posted a term to describe Azerbaijanis that Facebook interpreted as a slur. The board similarly ruled that ""the context in which the term was used makes clear it was meant to dehumanize its target,"" and upheld Facebook's decision.

The third case pertained to nudity: The board overturned Facebook’s decision to remove an Instagram post from a user in Brazil intended to raise awareness about breast cancer. The post included five photographs that showed women’s nipples, which the board declared permissible in light of Facebook’s own policy exception for “breast cancer awareness.”

The fourth case pertained to violence: One user quoted Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propagandist who is on Facebook’s list of “dangerous individuals.” Facebook policy states that quotes attributed to such individuals are an expression of support for that individual unless otherwise stated. But the board said the quote “did not support the Nazi party’s ideology or the regime’s acts of hate and violence.”

The fifth and final case pertained to misinformation: Facebook had removed a post from a user in France that falsely claimed a cure for Covid-19 existed and criticized the French government for failing to make it available. Facebook said the post could lead people to ignore health guidance or attempt to self-medicate.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers are balking at the cost of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 rescue plan — but the Biden team is trying to convince the country that the cost is a bargain compared to the potential damage to the world’s largest economy.

Biden hammered the message at a Friday meeting with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

“We have learned from past crises that the risk is not doing too much,” Biden said. “The risk is not doing enough.”

Yellen reversed his statement to make the same point.

“The price of doing nothing is much higher than the price of doing something and doing something big,” she said. “We need to act now.”

As faltering attempts to strike a deal with Republicans have led to concerns about delays in coronavirus relief and Senate Democrats prepare to pass a measure along party lines, the Biden administration said on Friday it’s taking “creative steps” to get broader public support for its plan. The Biden-Yellen meeting occurred as health officials provided a briefing about the course of the disease and vaccines, an attempt to update the public with a flood of information about efforts to contain the pandemic.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden recognizes the importance of speaking directly to the American people about his plan for vaccinations and supporting the economy, but the pandemic has limited his ability to safely travel the country to drum up support. That has left the administration relying on TV interviews with local media and outreach to governors and local officials as well as to progressive and civic groups.

“We’re taking a number of creative steps, a little outside of the box,” Psaki said. “Certainly, his preference would be to get on a plane and fly around the country.”

Despite Biden’s calls for unity, Democrats said the stubbornly high unemployment numbers and battered U.S. economy leave them unwilling to waste time courting Republican support that might not materialize. They also don’t want to curb the size and scope of a package that they say will provide desperately needed money to distribute vaccine, reopen schools and send cash to American households and businesses.

The standoff over Biden’s first legislative priority is turning the new rescue plan into a political test — of his new administration, of Democratic control of Congress and of the role of Republicans in a post-Trump political landscape .

Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing $400 billion to expand vaccinations and to reopen schools, $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency.

The Biden team has largely focused on direct outreach to lawmakers, but that has failed to generate much public pressure that could make Republicans more willing to reach a deal on the administration’s timeline.

A Republican Senate aide said that lawmakers’ offices are not being bombarded with calls for an additional aid package, saying that constituents are mainly focused on the looming impeachment trial . The aide spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Democrats in the House and the Senate are operating as though they know they are on borrowed time. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are laying the groundwork to start the go-it-alone approach as soon as next week.

They are drafting a budget reconciliation bill that would start the process to pass the relief package with a simple 51-vote Senate majority — rather than the 60-vote threshold typically needed in the Senate to advance legislation. The goal would be passage by March, when jobless benefits, housing assistance and other aid is set to expire.

Schumer said he drew from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s advice to “act big” to weather the COVID-19 economic crisis.

“Everywhere you look, alarm bells are ringing,” Schumer said from the Senate floor.

Senate Republicans in a bipartisan group warned their colleagues in a “frank” conversation late Wednesday that Biden and Democrats are making a mistake by loading up the aid bill with other priorities and jamming it through Congress without their support, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private session.

Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, a former White House budget director under George W. Bush, wants a deeper accounting of what funds remain from the $900 billion coronavirus aid package from December.

“Literally, the money has not gone out the door,” he said. “I’m not sure I understand why there’s a grave emergency right now.”

Biden spoke directly with Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who is leading the bipartisan effort with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that is racing to strike a compromise.

Collins said she and the Democratic president had a “good conversation.”

“We both expressed our shared belief that it is possible for the Senate to work in a bipartisan way to get things done for the people of this country,” she said.

The emerging debate is reminiscent of the partisan divide over the 2009 financial rescue in the early months of the Obama administration, when Biden was vice president, echoing those battles over the appropriate level of government intervention. The difference is that then-President Barack Obama and Biden could tour the country to rally support, an option that is more difficult now.

Employers shed workers in December, retail sales have slumped and COVID-19 deaths keep rising. More than 430,000 people in the U.S. have died from the coronavirus.

The government reported Thursday that the economy showed dangerous signs of stalling in the final three months of last year, ultimately shrinking in size by 3.5% for the whole of 2020 — the sharpest downturn since the demobilization that followed the end of World War II.

The decline was not as severe as initially feared, largely because the government has steered roughly $4 trillion in aid, an unprecedented emergency expenditure, to keep millions of Americans housed, fed, employed and able to pay down debt and build savings amid the crisis.

Republicans touted the 4% annualized growth during the last quarter, with economic analyst Stephen Moore calling the gains “amazing.”

Republicans have also raised concerns about adding to the deficit, which skyrocketed in the Trump administration.

Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the third-ranking party leader, said Biden should stick to the call for unity he outlined in his inaugural address, particularly with the evenly split Senate. “If there’s ever been a mandate to move to the middle, it’s this,” he said. “It’s not let’s just go off the cliff.”"	-15.18

WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell but remained at a historically high 847,000 last week, a sign that layoffs keep coming as the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage.

Last week’s claims dropped by 67,000, from 914,000 the week before, the Labor Department said Thursday. Before the virus hit the United States hard last March, weekly applications for jobless aid had never topped 700,000.

Tempering last week’s bigger-than-expected drop in claims: The four-week moving average — which smooths out week to week gyrations — rose by more than 16,000 last week to 868,000, highest since September.

Overall, nearly 4.8 million Americans received traditional state unemployment benefits the week of Jan. 16. That is down from nearly 5 million the week before and far below a staggering peak of nearly 25 million in May when the virus brought economic activity to a near halt. The drop suggests that some of the unemployed are finding new jobs and that others have exhausted state benefits.

There is optimism that COVID-19 vaccines will end the health crisis and help stabilize the economy, but that effort is moving forward haltingly and right now, the job market is stressed.

The United States is now recording just under 150,000 new coronavirus cases a day. That is down from nearly 250,000 a day early this month but still more than twice the levels seen from March until a resurgence in cases in late October. More than 425,000 Americans have died from the pandemic and health experts are warning the U.S. will hit 500,000 deaths.

The virus has forced state and local governments to restrict operations of restaurants, bars and other businesses and has discouraged Americans from venturing out of their homes.

Since February, the United States has lost 9.8 million jobs, including 140,000 in December.

Americans who lost work because of the pandemic can get aid from extended relief programs, which now offer up to 50 weeks of benefits, or from a new program that targets contractors and the self-employed. Altogether, 18.3 million people were receiving some type of unemployment benefit the week that ended Jan. 9, the latest period for which data is available.

A new government financial aid package provides, among other things, a $300-a-week federal unemployment benefit on top of regular state jobless aid. The new benefit runs through mid-March.

Once vaccines become more widely distributed, economists expect growth to accelerate in the second half of the year as Americans unleash pent-up demand for travel, dining out and visiting movie theaters and concert halls. Such spending could boost hiring.

But for now, the economy is floundering. Retail sales have fallen for three straight months. Restrictions on restaurants, bars and some stores, along with a reluctance of most Americans to shop, travel and eat out, have led to sharp spending cutbacks.

The Ultimate Kronos Group, a company that provides time-tracking software to small businesses, said the number of shifts worked by its clients dropped 2.5% in the second to last week of January from a month earlier. The drop was biggest — 4.3% — in the Southeast. “As we near the end of January, it’s clear that the national labor recovery is still struggling to return from the slow holiday season,′ said David Gilbertson, vice president at UKG.

The data firm Womply reports that as of Jan. 21 spending at local businesses is down 23% from a year earlier and that 26% are closed, including 30% of restaurants and 42% of bars. Hotels report a 51% drop in revenue.

President Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.9 trillion coronavirus plan that would provide, among other things, $1,400 checks for most Americans, which, on top of the $600 checks already being distributed, would bring the total to $2,000 per adult.

The new plan would also make available $400 a week in federal benefits for jobless Americans and extend a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures through September. Biden’s proposal will require congressional approval, and congressional Republicans are already balking at its size.

“Additional fiscal stimulus and broader vaccine diffusion should support an improved labor market in the spring,″ economists Nancy Vanden Houten and Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics wrote in a research note. “But claims are expected to remain high in the near term as the pandemic continues to restrict activity, with new strains of the virus a concern.″

"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18

Mayor Bill de Blasio wants 5 million New Yorkers vaccinated by June. Vaccines being given out in the Bronx this week. Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times In his final State of the City address, Mayor Bill de Blasio offered a sprawling vision of New York City’s recovery from a pandemic that has taken tens of thousands of lives and destroyed the city’s economy. The mayor committed to accelerating the city’s vaccination efforts and set a goal of inoculating five million New Yorkers by June. He also said he would begin in May to bring back to offices the thousands of city employees who have been working remotely, and would safely reopen schools for all students in September. “New York City’s vaccination effort is the foundation of a recovery for all of us,” the mayor’s 18-page recovery plan says. “With every vaccine shot, New York City moves closer and closer to fully reopening our economy, restoring the jobs we lost and ensuring equality in our comeback.” If the federal government provides enough stimulus dollars to the city, Mr. de Blasio said, he will create a City Cleanup Corps of 10,000 temporary workers to focus on beautifying the city — an idea he compared to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression. Mr. de Blasio also proposed two plans to help small businesses: a $50 million “recovery tax credit” program for businesses that have faced hardships from the pandemic, and a $100 million “recovery loan” program to help shops stay open. The city will provide low-interest loans of up to $100,000 to roughly 2,000 small businesses, according to the mayor’s plan. But Mr. de Blasio has also warned that the city is facing major budget cuts and layoffs. He recently announced that the city’s property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, driven by a drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties that have emptied out during the pandemic. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have expressed optimism that President Biden, along with a Democratic-led Congress, will bring substantial assistance to the city. Mr. de Blasio also called for higher taxes on wealthy New Yorkers in his speech — a policy he has pushed for years, but that Mr. Cuomo has opposed. Mr. de Blasio noted that more than 100 billionaires in the state increased their net worth by billions of dollars during the pandemic and called again for a redistribution of wealth. “There is clearly enough money in New York to invest in a fair and fast recovery — it’s just in the wrong hands,” he said.

Pregnant women receive conflicting advice on vaccines. The world’s leading health organizations are giving conflicting advice regarding vaccinations for pregnant women. Credit... Callaghan O'Hare/Reuters Pregnant women looking for guidance on Covid-19 vaccines are facing confusion of the sort that has dogged the pandemic from the start: The world’s leading public health organizations — the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization — are offering contradictory advice. The C.D.C.’s advisory committee urged pregnant women to consult with their doctors before rolling up their sleeves — a decision applauded by several women’s health organizations because it kept decision-making in the hands of the expecting mothers. But the W.H.O. is recommending that pregnant women not receive the vaccines, unless they are at high risk from Covid-19 because of work exposures or chronic conditions. It issued guidance on the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, stirring uncertainty among women and doctors on social media. (Earlier this month, it had published similar guidance on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.) Several experts expressed dismay at the W.H.O.’s stance, saying the risks to pregnant women from Covid were far greater than any theoretical harm from the vaccines. “There are no documented risks to the fetus, there’s no theoretical risks, there’s no risk in animal studies,” from the vaccines, said Dr. Anne Lyerly, a bioethicist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The difference of opinion between the C.D.C. and the W.H.O. is not rooted in scientific evidence, but the lack of it: Pregnant women have been barred from participating in clinical trials of the vaccines, reflecting a long tradition of excluding pregnant women from biomedical research and one that is now being challenged. While the rationale is ostensibly to protect women and their unborn children, prohibiting pregnant women from studies pushes the risk out of the carefully controlled environment of a clinical trial and into the real world. Vaccines are generally considered to be safe, and pregnant women have been urged to be immunized for influenza and other diseases since the 1960s, even in the absence of rigorous clinical trials to test them. “As obstetricians we are often faced with difficult decisions about using interventions in pregnancy that have not been properly tested in pregnancy,” said Dr. Denise Jamieson, an obstetrician at Emory University in Atlanta and a member of the Covid expert group at the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The college strongly advocated including pregnant and breastfeeding women in the vaccine trials. In a statement, the C.D.C. said on Thursday that based on how the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines work, “they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for pregnant women.” The C.D.C.’s recommendation may make sense for the United States, where women may easily be able to consult with their health care providers, said Joachim Hombach, a health adviser to the W.H.O. on immunizations. But the W.H.O. provides guidance to many low and middle income countries where women do not have access to doctors or nurses, he said. The W.H.O.’s recommendation was also made “in the context of limited supply” of the vaccines, Dr. Hombach said. “I don’t think the language is discouraging, but the language is stating the facts.” Pfizer plans to begin a clinical study in pregnant women in the first half of 2021. Moderna said it was establishing a registry to record outcomes in pregnant women who receive its vaccine. Apoorva Mandavilli and

global roundup W.H.O. experts tracing the virus’s origins start their fieldwork in China, and other news from around the world. A team of World Health Organization scientists in Wuhan, China, on Friday. Credit... Hector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images After months of delays, a team of World Health Organization scientists tracing the pandemic’s origin began its field work on Friday in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus was first detected. The W.H.O. said its team of 15 experts planned to visit hospitals, laboratories and a live animal market over the next several weeks in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, where the virus was detected in late 2019. “As members start their field visits on Friday, they should receive the support, access and the data they need,” the W.H.O. said on Twitter. “All hypotheses are on the table as the team follows the science in their work to understand the origins of the #COVID19 virus.” The Chinese government had repeatedly sought to delay the inquiry, apparently out of concern that the experts would draw attention to the government’s early missteps in handling the outbreak. But it relented under mounting global pressure. The W.H.O. experts were first asked to undergo 14 days of quarantine in Wuhan, which ended on Thursday. They plan to speak with some of the first patients to show symptoms of Covid-19, as well as with medical workers and Chinese scientists, according to the W.H.O. Their fieldwork will include a visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where some of the first cases were detected. They will also visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology and a laboratory operated by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The question of the pandemic’s origin has caused friction between China and the United States, with officials in each country at times blaming the other for unleashing the virus on the world. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that the United States hoped for a “robust and clear” international investigation. Chinese officials, in response, defended the country’s handling of the inquiry. “We hope the U.S. side will work with China, take on a responsible attitude and respect facts, science and the diligent work of W.H.O. experts,” Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday. Chinese officials said on Friday that several passengers traveling to China from the United States had falsified coronavirus test results so they could gain entry to the country. The Chinese consulate in San Francisco said the passengers had “changed their test results from positive to negative” and that other travelers had lied about test results. The consulate did not provide details about the passengers or the punishments they might face. China maintains strict border control rules, including a requirement that travelers present results from antibody and nucleic acid tests before they fly. The consulate said the passengers had violated public health laws. “The way they put others at risk is odious,” the statement said.

Vietnam recorded nine more coronavirus cases on Friday, including one in the capital, Hanoi, as a new outbreak spread beyond the two northern provinces where infections had first been detected a day earlier. Officials put the number of cases from the latest outbreak at 93 as of Friday afternoon but said that it could reach 30,000, nearly 20 times the number of cases that Vietnam detected during the entire first year of the pandemic. Vietnam has been among the most successful countries in containing the virus, with strict border controls, mask-wearing, contact tracing and isolation of infected people. The latest outbreak comes as officials from the governing Communist Party meet to select the country’s new leaders, an event held once every five years.

Hungary’s medicine authority has approved the coronavirus vaccine developed by the Chinese company Sinopharm. “This means that in addition to Pfizer, Moderna, Sputnik and AstraZeneca, we can also count on Sinopharm,” said Dr. Cecilia Muller, the country’s chief medical officer. “We trust that these vaccines will be readily available in large quantities and the immunization process will be completed in larger numbers in less time.” The country’s foreign minister later announced that it had purchased five million doses of the vaccine. Regarding the options, Prime Minister Viktor Orban expressed enthusiasm for the Chinese vaccine on Friday. “I will wait for the Chinese vaccine,” he said. “I trust that one the most.” Javier C. Hernández, Richard C. Paddock and

New York severely undercounted virus deaths in nursing homes, a report says. Emergency medical technicians lifting a man after moving him from a nursing home into an ambulance in Brooklyn. Credit... Lucas Jackson/Reuters An investigation by the New York State attorney general has concluded that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s administration undercounted coronavirus-related deaths at nursing homes by as much as 50 percent. The count of deaths in state nursing homes has been a source of controversy for Mr. Cuomo and state Health Department officials, who have been sensitive to any suggestion that decisions made at the outset of the pandemic may have caused some of those deaths, which the state puts at more than 8,700. They have also been accused of obscuring a more accurate estimate of nursing home deaths, because the state only counted deaths at the actual facilities, rather than including deaths of residents who were transferred to a hospital and died there. In the 76-page report released on Thursday by the attorney general, Letitia James, a survey of nursing homes found consistent discrepancies between deaths reported to the attorney general’s investigators and those reported to and officially released by the Health Department. In one instance, an unnamed facility reported to the Health Department that it had 11 confirmed and presumed deaths on site through early August. The attorney general’s survey of that same facility, however, found 40 deaths, including 27 at the home and 13 in hospitals. Another facility reported one confirmed and six presumed Covid-19 deaths to the Health Department, according to the report. The attorney general’s office, however, said the facility reported to its investigators that there were more than four times that number — 31 dead — by mid-April. Deaths in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have accounted for about a third of the nation’s some 430,000 deaths. Federal and state authorities have made vaccinating staff and residents at such facilities a top priority, though that effort has been slower than hoped. In New York, where there have been more than 42,000 virus-related deaths, the toll in the state’s nursing homes has been a particular source of agony for residents and their families. It has also been a political liability for Mr. Cuomo, who has pushed back on accusations that his administration did not do enough to safeguard a highly vulnerable population. The findings of Ms. James would seem to put her in rare conflict with Mr. Cuomo, the state’s three-term Democratic incumbent. Ms. James was the governor’s favored choice to succeed Eric T. Schneiderman after he suddenly resigned as attorney general in 2018; she readily embraced Mr. Cuomo’s political backing. The attorney general asked 62 nursing homes — about a tenth of the state’s total — for information about on-site and in-hospital deaths related to the virus; investigators then cross-referenced that information with public reports of deaths issued by the Health Department. The deaths reported to the attorney general’s office at most of those facilities totaled 1,914, compared to the state’s much lower count of 1,229. Ms. James said that her office was investigating those circumstances “where the discrepancies cannot reasonably be accounted for by error or the difference in the question posed.” The attorney general said she was continuing to conduct investigations of more than 20 nursing homes across the state that “presented particular concern,” noting that “other law enforcement agencies also have ongoing investigations relating to nursing homes.”

A Washington hospital system apologizes after offering vaccines to wealthy donors. The Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue, Wash., last spring. Credit... Grant Hindsley for The New York Times A Washington hospital system apologized after The Seattle Times reported that it had offered vaccines to wealthy donors while others went without the coveted shots. Overlake Medical Center & Clinics sent an email to about 110 donors who gave more than $10,000 to the hospital system, telling them they could register for open appointments “by invite” only. The report drew a rebuke from Gov. Jay Inslee, who said during a news conference on Tuesday that the practice was “simply unacceptable.” Overlake’s president and chief executive, J. Michael Marsh, apologized in a statement, adding that even those donors would have been required to show that they were eligible for the vaccine under state guidelines. “We recognize we made a mistake by including a subset of our donors and by not adopting a broader outreach strategy to fill these appointments, and we apologize,” Mr. Marsh said. The hospital’s conduct mirrors that of other facilities that have made news for prioritizing wealthy donors over the rest of the population. A Florida nursing home and assisted living facility called MorseLife Health System came under investigation after The Washington Post and The New York Post reported that it had prioritized its donors as well. Another, Baptist Health in Miami, invited a donor to get a shot. The recipient said she believed she was offered a vaccine because she had donated and volunteered for the hospital. And in Jefferson City, widespread confusion led some Missouri lawmakers to scramble for shots that were not intended for them. Group texts among House members and staff said vaccines were available at an area hotel, but the shots were meant for the state’s public safety and transportation employees. Mr. Inslee said during Tuesday’s news conference that Washington State’s biggest barrier to widespread vaccine distribution was supply. As of Thursday, 6.2 percent of the state’s population had received their first dose. Just 1.2 percent had received the full two doses. After hearing of the prioritizing of donors, Mr. Inslee said he believed that the hospital had halted that practice. “We have to maintain public credibility in this system,” he said.

A ‘bunch of kids’ ran a major vaccination site for Philadelphia. Then the city cut its ties. The vaccination site at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia earlier this month. Credit... Kimberly Paynter/WHYY With pressure mounting to get Covid-19 vaccine doses into arms as quickly as possible, many overburdened city health departments across the country have turned to partnerships with hospitals, nonprofit organizations and pharmacies. In Philadelphia this week, one such deal went awry after the city leaned on a start-up led by college students who were eager to get involved but had little experience. The start-up is an organization called Philly Fighting Covid, which was founded last year by a 22-year-old graduate student, Andrei Doroshin. The group quickly won plaudits for volunteering to run free testing sites, and for using 3-D printers to make face shields that it supplied free to health care workers. So when Philadelphia began receiving shipments of vaccine and needed help administering doses on a large scale, the city health department turned to Philly Fighting Covid to operate what would be the largest vaccination site in the state, at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. It took less than three weeks after vaccinations began for the partnership to sour. Since it opened on Jan. 8, the site has vaccinated nearly 7,000 people, though there were reports in local media that appointments had been overbooked and some people were turned away. Mr. Doroshin attributed those problems to issues with an online sign-up system that allowed thousands of ineligible people to register for appointments. Then on Tuesday, the city health commissioner, Thomas Farley, said at a news conference that the health department would no longer work with Philly Fighting Covid. The city learned, he said, that the group had unexpectedly canceled its testing efforts to focus on vaccination; that it planned to change from nonprofit status to a for-profit company; and that it had changed its data privacy policy to allow it to potentially sell data about patients to third parties, a step first reported by the public radio station WHYY. “We did not think that was appropriate,” Dr. Farley said about the data policy. “We thought, ‘If there’s any attempt to do this, even the possibility, then people won’t trust this organization.’” In an interview, Mr. Doroshin said his group had only the best intentions, but he acknowledged its inexperience. “We’re a bunch of kids,” Mr. Doroshin said. “I didn’t know anything about legal structure before this. I didn’t care. I’m not a lawyer, I’m a nerd. People are trying to make me out to be this nefarious thing. I’m like, ‘Dude, I didn’t know all the rules of a nonprofit organization until I did this.’” He said that the company had decided to switch to a for-profit structure in order to expand quickly, and that it had not hid its intentions from the city. Mr. Doroshin did acknowledge that there were problems with the organization’s privacy policy, which he said was posted in haste. But he said that the group had not sold or otherwise disseminated any of the patient data it collected, and that the posted policy “was frankly just a mistake.” Katrina Lipinsky, a registered nurse who volunteered at the group’s vaccination site, said in an interview that at the end of one day, after the group tried to find takers for a number of leftover doses, she saw Mr. Doroshin put a few in his backpack, along with the vaccination cards that are used to track vaccination timelines. She said she had reported it to city investigators. “Obviously, that didn’t seem right,” she said. Dr. Farley, the health commissioner, told reporters that any leftover vaccine doses should have been given back to the health department. He said the department was looking into the matter. “If that’s true, that’s very disturbing,” he said. “They shouldn’t have done that.” In the interview, Mr. Doroshin acknowledged that he took four doses home with him and administered them to friends. He said that he should have had a nurse present when he gave the shots, but that he did not regret making use of doses that would otherwise have expired that night. “I’m OK with being a person that broke a rule to not have any vaccine left over,” he said. “If that’s the final word I have in my book, then that’s OK. I’m OK with dying with that.” Lucy Tompkins and

Fauci, addressing teachers, urges a speedy return to school. About a third of U.S. school are entirely remote. Credit... Bridget Bennett for The New York Times Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, addressing more than 6,000 American teachers in a video meeting, said Thursday evening that students need to return to the classroom for the country to begin recovering. “We are not going to get back to normal until we get the children back in school, for the good of the children, the good of the parents and the good of the community,” he said. Attending a meeting convened by the two national teachers unions, Dr. Fauci brought with him the message of the Biden administration: that all K-8 schools should aim to reopen within the next 100 days. He said they can expect support from Washington in the form of a new stimulus package to fund sanitation upgrades and other safety measures. As of last month, about one third of American school districts were operating entirely remotely, and Dr. Fauci acknowledged that “mitigating factors” may make the 100-day goal difficult to achieve in some places. Fielding questions submitted by educators, he did not hesitate to acknowledge potential dangers. He discussed the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus that appear more contagious and more resistant to vaccines. And he said that while he expected vaccines to prevent inoculated teachers from passing the virus onto their loved ones, there was not yet concrete evidence that would be the case. As Dr. Fauci spoke, educators at the meeting posted comments — many reflecting frustration and anxiety. They complained that many states had not prioritized teachers for vaccination and said students were not able to effectively stay masked throughout the school day. Several called for job actions. “Teachers need to participate in a national strike to protect kids, communities, and teachers,” one wrote. Dr. Fauci appeared alongside two powerful teachers union presidents: Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers and Becky Pringle of the National Education Association. The event took place as some local unions across the country, most notably in Chicago, continue to resist efforts to reopen schools, arguing that doing so before widespread teacher vaccination would risk lives. Ms. Weingarten has staked out a somewhat more moderate position, arguing that schools can operate safely before teachers are vaccinated by using strategies such as surveillance testing for the virus and updating ventilation systems. She has also asked for teachers with health concerns, or who live with family members with compromised immune systems, to be allowed to continue to work remotely.

As vaccine supplies lag, tensions grow in the E.U. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:07 - 0:00 transcript E.U. Pushes for AstraZeneca to Provide More Vaccines The European Union is pushing for AstraZeneca to supply more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine after announcing on Wednesday that it would cut deliveries by 60 percent due to manufacturing issues. Not being able to ensure manufacturing capacity is against the letter and the spirit of our agreement. We reject the logic of first come, first served. That may work at the neighborhood butcher’s, but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements. There’s no priority clause in the advance purchase agreement, and also there’s also no hierarchy of the full production plants named in the advance purchase agreement. In the contracts, there are four, I think, four factories listed, but it does not differentiate between the U.K. and the Europe — the U.K. factories are part of our advance purchase agreements, and this is why they have to deliver. Pharmaceutical companies, vaccine developers have moral, societal and contractual responsibilities, which they need to uphold. The view that the company is not obliged to deliver because we signed a best effort agreement is neither correct nor is it acceptable. The European Union is pushing for AstraZeneca to supply more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine after announcing on Wednesday that it would cut deliveries by 60 percent due to manufacturing issues. Credit Credit... Manu Brabo/Getty Images “Tomorrow our fridges will be empty.” That warning came from Josep Maria Argimon, a health official in Catalonia, and he was referring not to food but to the dwindling supplies of something almost as precious: the coronavirus vaccine. On Wednesday, Spain became the first European country to partly suspend immunizations because of a lack of doses. It did so first in Madrid, for two weeks, and said that Catalonia, the northeastern region that includes Barcelona, could soon follow. It has not gone easily for the European Union since it approved its first vaccine in late December and rushed to begin a vast immunization campaign across its 27 member states. But the early problems have snowballed into a full-blown crisis. Countries across the bloc have felt the pain of vaccine shortages even as a new wave of the virus rages. The pandemic has prompted prolonged lockdowns in most member countries, and there is also anxiety over the spread of at least two highly infectious variants that are straining national health systems. It is unclear when the supply might improve. The bloc is also in an escalating dispute with AstraZeneca over the drug maker’s announcement that it would cut deliveries by 60 percent because of production shortfalls. And Pfizer informed the European Union this month that it had to drastically cut its vaccine deliveries until mid-February while it upgraded its plants to ramp up output, adding to the supply problems. In a rare bit of good news, the French drug maker Sanofi said on Wednesday that it would help produce more than 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, starting this summer — but those doses will most likely come too late to salvage vaccination plans for the first half of 2021. When the European Union approved its first vaccine in December, it was already weeks behind nations like the United States and Britain. While it is flush with cash, influence and negotiating heft, the bloc of 27 nations has also found itself lagging countries such as Israel, Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Last week, the European Union’s executive branch, the European Commission, set a goal of having 70 percent of its population inoculated by this summer. Just days later, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, pronounced that “difficult.” As of this week, a mere 2 percent of E.U. citizens had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to numbers collected by the research site Our World in Data. That compares with around 40 percent for Israel, 11 percent for Britain and just over 6 percent for the United States. Many countries, particularly poorer ones, are struggling to secure any vaccines at all. But the delays in Europe have created tensions. Some critics have blamed the European Commission, which struck deals on behalf of the member states to secure a total of 2.3 billion vaccine doses from several companies. Some of its agreements were struck weeks after those reached by the United States and Britain. AstraZeneca and some European opposition politicians say that the delay put the bloc at the back of the line for deliveries. The commission has challenged those claims. “We reject the logic of first-come, first-served,” the bloc’s heath commissioner, Stella Kyriakides, said at a news conference on Wednesday. “That may work at the neighborhood butcher, but not in contracts and not in our advanced purchase agreements.” Matina Stevis-Gridneff and

A German health body advises against using the AstraZeneca shot in people over 65. Preparing a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Credit... Silvia Izquierdo/Associated Press Germany’s vaccination advisory committee, which provides recommendations to the government, is cautioning against using the AstraZeneca shot on adults age 65 and above, saying in a draft report released on Thursday that “there currently is not sufficient data to assess the vaccination effectiveness above 65 years.” The German Health Ministry, which usually follows the advice of the committee, declined to comment. The European Medicines Agency, the regulatory body for the European Union, is expected to announce on Friday whether the vaccine will be approved for use in the bloc. Britain has been administering the AstraZeneca shots to all age groups after it became the first country to give the vaccine emergency authorization, in December. British regulators have said that data on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine “are currently limited” in people age 65 and older. But concerns about the scarce data on older people could limit the use of the AstraZeneca shot: European regulators are considering authorizing it only for people under 65, two E.U. officials said. Neither AstraZeneca nor Oxford University, which helped develop the vaccine, has released figures on how effective the shot is in older people. But data on older people’s immune responses have suggested that the vaccine will help protect them from the virus, the company has said. The Oxford team, which was in charge of the earliest trials of the vaccine, did not want to vaccinate older people until they had collected extensive safety data for younger participants, Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, said in an interview with La Repubblica, an Italian newspaper, this week. Other vaccine makers, Mr. Soriot said, decided to vaccinate older people in trials before they had accumulated as much safety data, allowing them to make stronger claims about efficacy in that age group. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration is waiting on data from a clinical trial that enrolled about 30,000 participants, mostly Americans, and that will include more older people. The results are expected in the coming weeks. AstraZeneca is expected to have sufficient safety data from that study to file for emergency use authorization from the F.D.A. around the first week of March.

Biden signs orders aimed at expanding health care access, including abortion, and opening Obamacare enrollment. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:06 - 0:00 transcript Health Care Orders Undo ‘Damage Trump Has Done,’ Biden Says President Biden took executive action to expand health care access by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reopening enrollment. He also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand abortion access. Today, we’re about to sign two executive orders. Basically, the best way to describe it, to undo the damage Trump has done. There’s nothing new that we’re doing. The first one I’m going to be signing here is to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. And of all times that we need to reinstate access to affordability of and extent of access to Medicaid, is now, in the middle of this Covid crisis. And the second order I’m signing relates to protecting women’s health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made in Title X and other things, making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to reproductive rights. President Biden took executive action to expand health care access by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reopening enrollment. He also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand abortion access. Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden, seeking to expand access to health care and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, used his executive authority Thursday to order the reopening of enrollment in the health law’s marketplaces and a re-examination of Trump administration policies that undermined protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. His aim, he said in a brief signing ceremony in the Oval Office, was to “undo the damage Trump has done.” Mr. Biden also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand access to abortion, and took separate executive action to overturn his predecessor’s restrictions on the use of taxpayer dollars for clinics that refer or counsel patients to terminate pregnancies, both in the United States and overseas. Taken together, Mr. Biden is trying to put a quick stamp on health policies that have been critical to a Democratic resurgence, especially those that back the Affordable Care Act, which he helped secure as President Barack Obama’s vice president. President Donald J. Trump failed to overturn the health law, but he spent four years undermining it with a series of executive actions, including allowing the sale of cheap, short-term and small-business health plans that do not meet the law’s health coverage mandates. Mr. Biden’s first step is to reopen enrollment for health coverage offered through the federal marketplace created under the health law, also known as Obamacare. His intent is to offer coverage not only to those who lost it during the pandemic, but also to those who did not have insurance and now want it, according to a senior administration official who previewed the new policy during a conference call Thursday morning. The so-called special enrollment period will run from Feb. 15 to May 15. The official said the reopening would be accompanied by the kind of robust patient outreach — including “paid advertising, direct outreach to consumers and partnerships” with community organizations and advocacy groups — that was abandoned by the Trump administration. Typically, Americans in the 36 states that rely on the federal marketplace can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year’s coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. Once the coronavirus struck, Mr. Trump faced pressure to reopen enrollment for the millions of Americans losing their jobs, but he refused. Mr. Biden’s actions take aim at a number of Mr. Trump’s policies. In 2018, citing complaints about the price of Obamacare coverage, the Trump administration issued a rule that extended the length of less expensive “short” term policies from three months to up to three years. Such policies do not have to cover pre-existing conditions and can exclude common benefits like maternity care, mental health care or prescription drugs. The former administration also made it easier for small businesses to band together and offer plans that escape some of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Biden has asked federal agencies to re-examine these rules, which could take months to undo. Should the rules be overturned, patients who have such policies would be unable to renew them, which could leave them without insurance if they think coverage is too expensive. Mr. Biden campaigned on raising the subsidies for Obamacare plans to make them more affordable. Mr. Biden’s executive actions on abortion put him in the center of the nation’s long-running culture wars. Like his Democratic predecessors, Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, he will immediately rescind the global gag rule — often called the “Mexico City Policy” — which bars international nonprofit organizations that provide abortion counseling from using American tax dollars. The rule has been riding a philosophical seesaw for decades — in place when a Republican occupies the White House, and overturned when a Democrat moves in. Mr. Biden’s revocation of the Mexico City Policy was part of an order that restored funding terminated by Mr. Trump to the United Nations Population Fund, known as UNFPA, the world’s leading provider of family planning services, and a major resource for millions of women in more than 120 countries. Mr. Trump’s decision nearly four years ago was a shock to the UNFPA, which had counted on the United States, a founding member, as a critical source of funding. Overnight, the agency lost nearly $70 million. Dr. Natalia Kanem, the fund’s executive director, welcomed Mr. Biden’s order, which she said would greatly help the agency’s work not only in family planning but in other health services to struggling women and girls in poor countries. “We now have the support of a very important member state,” Dr. Kanem said in a phone interview, expressing gratitude that the Biden administration had embraced her agency’s work around the world. Mr. Biden is also directing the Department of Health and Human Services to “take immediate action,” his administration said, to consider whether to rescind the so-called domestic gag rule — a regulation imposed by the Trump administration that prohibits family planning clinics that receive federal funding from counseling patients about abortion. Such a change would likely require the department to write new regulations, a process that could take months. The president’s Obamacare directive will also instruct federal agencies to review policies — including waivers that allowed states to impose work requirements — that discourage participation in Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Enrollment in Medicaid has grown substantially during the coronavirus pandemic, in part because people who have lost jobs and their health insurance have turned to Medicaid for coverage.

Inside the White House, strict rules aim to slow the spread of the coronavirus. President Biden swore in members of the White House staff remotely on Jan. 20. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Senior staff members in West Wing offices are prohibited from meeting together in an office for more than a total of 15 minutes in a day, according to a senior Biden administration official. No more than six people are allowed to gather in the Oval Office at a time, and a maximum of five staff members are allowed to meet together in the spacious office of the chief of staff, Ron Klain, the official said. That means that both the morning and afternoon senior staff meetings in the White House are conducted on video calls, even though many of the participants are working in offices near one another. In the Roosevelt Room, gatherings are limited to 10 people. And when staff members remove their masks to eat lunch at their desks, they are required to close their doors. Visitors are not allowed without approval, and West Wing staff members generally do not intermingle with the team working in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across the street. As the new administration finds its footing, life in the West Wing has become incredibly disciplined, partly because of the way President Biden’s team wants to work, but mostly because of the strict rules the administration has put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Unlike an administration functioning during normal times, the Biden team can’t simply add people to a meeting at the last minute, or run someone into the building. It couldn’t be more different in feel and temperament from the opening weeks of the Trump administration, when the Oval Office was often compared to Grand Central Terminal. Former President Donald J. Trump’s office served as a bustling focal point of all West Wing activity as aides wandered in and out and then simply hung about, once it was clear that there was no formal structure for meetings or policymaking, and that for Mr. Trump, out of sight was out of mind. All West Wing staff members are still tested daily even though a growing number of administration officials are getting vaccinated. There are also fewer people working in the building, and those who are there rarely leave the campus for lunch. There have been awkward moments in hallways, when staff members don’t recognize each other because everyone is required to wear an N95 mask and many have opted to double-mask, officials said. The measures are in place because of a realization that while it may be impossible to prevent the coronavirus from entering the White House complex entirely, it is possible to reduce the risk of widespread infection if someone on the president’s team gets sick. The rules have been put in place by Anne Filipic, the director of management and administration, and Jeff Wexler, the White House director of Covid-19 operations. A White House spokesman would not confirm the number of people allowed in meetings, or the time limits on such gatherings. But he said that in-person meetings were limited and that colleagues were socially distancing. So far, officials said, the measures appear to be working. But they concede that it’s a difficult way to run a White House, just as it was a difficult way to run a campaign and a difficult way to run a transition. “Adjusting to doing most meetings via video and doing most of our work with colleagues remotely has not been a massive leap,” said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary. “It has been a long adjustment as humans to not being able to hug old colleagues or shake hands with new ones, but so far we don’t feel that it has prevented us from doing our jobs.”

Luong Thai Linh/EPA, via Shutterstock Vietnam reported 82 coronavirus infections on Thursday, the first cases of local transmission in nearly two months, and the government said that some may be connected to the new variant that has been spreading rapidly in Britain. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has called on the two northern provinces where the cases were reported to close their borders to prevent people from leaving, the state-run news media reported on Thursday. Vietnam has been relatively successful in containing the virus. Before the latest outbreak in the northern provinces, Hai Duong and Quang Ninh, the country had reported only about 1,550 cases and 35 deaths. The new cases arrived at an inconvenient time. Officials from the governing Communist Party are meeting this week in Hanoi, the capital, to select their next leaders, an event that takes place once every five years. And people across the country are preparing to celebrate the Lunar New Year, Vietnam’s biggest holiday. Vietnam’s largest outbreak occurred in July in the central city of Danang, sickening hundreds and causing all 35 of the country’s reported deaths before it was contained. Health officials initially reported two new cases Thursday morning. But the number rose to 82 by the afternoon, after health workers began tracing and isolating the first patients’ contacts. Of 138 people tested in Hai Duong, 72 were positive for the virus, Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said, according to a recording of comments made at an urgent meeting on the sidelines of the Communist Party congress. All of those patients work at a local electronics factory, local news media reported. The first worker found to have contracted the virus is said to have had contact with a Vietnamese national who later traveled to Japan, where he tested positive for the variant that has spread in Britain. The other 10 cases appear to have originated with a worker at Van Don International Airport in Quang Ninh Province who was responsible for taking arriving passengers to quarantine.

China cancels Lunar New Year celebrations for millions of migrants. Hankou Station in Wuhan, China, last week. A year ago, the station was among the first places to be closed after the coronavirus outbreak. Credit... Roman Pilipey/EPA, via Shutterstock Every winter, Pang Qingguo, a fruit seller in northern China, makes the 800-mile trip to his ancestral home to celebrate the Lunar New Year, the biggest holiday of the year in China, with his family. The coronavirus ruined the festivities last year, stranding Mr. Pang in the northern city of Tangshan as many Chinese cities imposed lockdowns. Now, as China confronts a resurgence of the virus, the pandemic is set to spoil the holiday again, with the authorities announcing onerous quarantine and testing rules to dissuade migrant workers like Mr. Pang from traveling for the new year, which begins this year on Feb. 12. Mr. Pang, who describes his home in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang as the “happiest place,” is anguished by the rules. He has taken to social media in recent days to express frustration about his situation and post photographs of his 7-year-old daughter, whom he has not seen in more than a year. “Society is so cruel,” he wrote in one post. Many of China’s roughly 300 million migrant workers face a similar reality as the government tries to avoid a surge in cases during what is typically the busiest travel season of the year. The authorities have demanded that people visiting rural areas during the holiday spend two weeks in quarantine and pay for their own coronavirus tests. Many migrants, who endure grueling jobs for meager wages in big cities, say those restrictions make it impossible to travel. The rollout of the rules has drawn widespread criticism in China, with many people calling the approach unfair to migrant workers, who have long been treated as second-class citizens under China’s strict household registration system. The workers have been among the most deeply affected by the pandemic, as the authorities have carried out scattered lockdowns to fight the virus and employers have reduced hours and pay. In a regular year, hundreds of millions of people travel by plane, train and car to be with their families for the Lunar New Year. The holiday, which typically includes big festive banquets and fireworks, is normally the only time that many workers can return to their hometowns to see loved ones. This year, many are making plans to spend the holiday alone. Javier C. Hernández and

Prisoners at Guantánamo Bay will be offered vaccination, the Pentagon says. Troops and civilian residents at the U.S. naval base and military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, are already being vaccinated. Officials said shots would be offered to detainees as well. Credit... Alex Brandon/Associated Press WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has decided to offer coronavirus vaccines to detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, possibly starting next week, according to a prosecutor in the case against five prisoners accused of conspiring in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The prosecutor, Clayton G. Trivett Jr., wrote to defense lawyers on Thursday “that an official in the Pentagon has just signed a memo approving the delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine to the detainee population in Guantánamo.” Medical workers at the U.S. naval base began vaccinating the 6,000 residents on Jan. 8, including the 1,500 troops assigned to the detention operation. But the Trump administration had declined to say whether prisoners would be vaccinated. The 40 detainees at the prison complex could start receiving the first of the two required doses of vaccine“on a voluntary basis” as soon as Monday, Mr. Trivett said. Under Pentagon policy, because the Food and Drug Administration has given only emergency-use authorization to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, the recipient’s consent is required to administer the shots. It is not known how many people at Guantánamo have been infected with the coronavirus. Early in the pandemic, the military reported two cases there, both believed to be sailors. The Defense Department then halted disclosure of data about specific installations. Lack of vaccinations has been a major obstacle to resuming war crimes hearings at the base’s Camp Justice compound. It was not immediately known whether the defendants in the Sept. 11 case, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, would consent to be vaccinated. An Army judge has scheduled an arraignment on Feb. 22 for three prisoners accused of conspiring in deadly terrorist attacks in Indonesia in 2002 and 2003. Under the timeline described by Mr. Trivett, prisoners who agree to be vaccinated could receive their second dose on the eve of the arraignment, the first at Guantánamo’s war court since 2014. The arraignment hearing would be the first court appearance for the three detainees — Encep Nurjaman, who is known as Hambali; Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep; and Mohammed Farik Bin Amin — who have been in U.S. custody since they were captured in Thailand in 2003. Mr. Hambali, who is Indonesian, is held at Guantánamo as the former leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian extremist group that became an Al Qaeda affiliate before the Sept. 11 attacks. The other two men are Malaysians accused of being Mr. Hambali’s accomplices in the 2002 nightclub bombings in Bali, which killed 202 people, and the 2003 Marriott hotel bombing in Jakarta, which killed at least 11 people and wounded at least 80. Lawyers for several of the detainees said they would need to consult with their clients by letter about whether to consent to be vaccinated. Dr. Terry Adirim, the Pentagon’s principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, signed the memo authorizing the vaccination of the detainees on Wednesday, said Mike Howard, a Pentagon spokesman."	-15.18
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday reopened the nation’s online health insurance marketplace for people who cannot obtain coverage through their employers, in a move he said was aimed at undoing “damage” done by his predecessor Donald Trump.

In an executive order, Biden restored access to healthcare.gov, allowing Americans to sign up for insurance through the government exchange from Feb. 15 to May 15, the White House said. The program is normally accessible for just six weeks in the fall.

Biden, who took office last week, also directed federal agencies to “re-examine” Trump-era policies like work requirements that made it more difficult for people to qualify for Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor.

The actions were the latest in a blizzard of moves by the new Democratic president to reverse the policies of the Republican Trump.

“Today I’m about to sign two executive orders - basically the best way to describe them - to undo the damage Trump has done,” Biden said in the Oval Office.

He also rescinded the “Mexico City Policy” that bans U.S. funding for international non-profit organizations that provide abortion counseling.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the decision as “a powerful message to women and girls around the world that their rights matter.”

Biden has vowed to shore up programs created under former President Barack Obama’s sweeping 2010 Affordable Care Act, arguing that the changes are urgent because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 430,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.

CORONAVIRUS PRIORITY

Biden has made battling the virus a priority of his first days in office and proposed a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package for individuals and businesses on top of $4 trillion in aid approved last year.

The U.S. Senate and House will begin moving forward on the plan next week, but Republicans and some Democrats have balked at the cost.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said after Thursday’s signing that Biden has been having calls with lawmakers on the legislation and said there is no intention to split the bill into two to ease passage.

She also said the Department of Health and Human Services will amend rules to allow recently retired doctors and nurses to administer the coronavirus vaccine to Americans, as it seeks to speed up the roll-out across the country.

Republicans said the move undercut Biden’s promise to work with both parties.

“These actions will not create the unity President Biden spoke about in his inaugural address,” Republican Representative Michael Burgess said.

Republicans have long criticized the law as too intrusive and expensive. They tried and failed to repeal it in 2017, when they controlled both chambers of Congress.

The Trump administration reduced spending on programs to help the uninsured sign up for federally subsidized private insurance under Obamacare.

It also set in motion a reduction in user fees that provide the bulk of exchange revenues, leading experts to warn that cuts in spending for consumer information, outreach and assistance activities could be difficult to reverse.

Psaki said Biden will issue executive orders on immigration next week. Reuters reported that the directives had been planned for Friday, but were delayed."	-15.18
"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18

The state's own public health lab later ""identified a separate case of the same variant"" in a sample tested on Monday, the South Carolina Department of Health said in a statement. While the strain appears to be highly transmissible, it doesn't appear to make people sicker, the health department said.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control said the strain, known as B.1.351, was found in two adults with no history of travel or connection to one another. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified South Carolina health officials late Wednesday that a sample that was tested at LabCorp was the B.1.351 variant, the health department said Thursday.

The first Covid-19 cases in the U.S. of a new, highly contagious strain of the virus first found in South Africa have been detected in South Carolina, the state's health department said Thursday.

The appearance of these new strains hasn't come as a surprise to scientists. The U.S. is quickly trying to ramp up its surveillance efforts to track the new strains through genomic sequencing, which could be coming from abroad or ""emanating from our own country,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC's new director, said last week.

""CDC is early in its efforts to understand this variant and will continue to provide updates as we learn more,"" the health agency said in a statement. ""CDC's recommendations for slowing the spread—wearing masks, staying at least 6 feet apart from others, avoiding crowds, ventilating indoor spaces, and washing hands often—will also prevent the spread of this variant.""

Both strains of the virus found in the U.K. and South Africa share similar mutations, but experts say they developed separately. Although it's no surprise the virus is mutating, researchers are quickly trying to determine what the changes might mean for recently developed lifesaving vaccines and treatments against the disease.

The B.1.351 strain appears to be more problematic than the emerging variant found in the U.K., White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday. Fauci said during a press briefing that the vaccine-induced antibodies might be less effective in combatting that strain, though ""it still is well within the cushion of protection.""

Early findings published in the preprint server bioRxiv, which have yet to be peer reviewed, indicate that the B.1.351 variant can evade the antibodies provided by some coronavirus treatments and may reduce the effectiveness of the current line of available vaccines. On Monday, Moderna said its vaccine might be less effective against the B.1.351 strain and that it's developing a so-called booster shot to guard against that variant ""out of an abundance of caution.""

Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a CNN interview Wednesday that the new mRNA technology used to develop the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines — the only two so far to receive emergency authorization in the U.S. — can be easily tweaked to target the variants.

Those booster shots wouldn't need to go through the rigorous phase three clinical trials that required thousands of participants, he added.

""You don't have to do a 30,000 person trial or a 40,000 person trial,"" Fauci said. ""You work with the FDA and you could bridge information from one trial to another. Bottom line is we're already on it.""

'Fueling Africa's second wave'

The World Health Organization warned Thursday that more contagious variants of Covid-19 are ""fueling Africa's second wave"" and the variant first identified in South Africa ""is predominant and powering record case numbers in South Africa and the sub-region.""

According to the WHO, the B.1.351 strain has now been identified in in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, the French Indian Ocean region of Mayotte, Zambia and 24 other non-African nations. As of Monday, Coronavirus infections in the region have grown by 50% since Dec. 29 when compared with the previous four weeks, the WHO said. Covid-19 deaths have also been on the rise, roughly doubling over that same period.

The WHO said it's working with the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to set up laboratories to conduct surveillance efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Uganda.

The United Nations health agency said each country should send at least 20 samples to the labs, which will ""help map the fast-evolving situation and best target responses at all levels.""

""The variant which was first detected in South Africa has spread quickly beyond Africa and so what's keeping me awake at night right now is that it's very likely circulating in a number of African countries,"" Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa, said in a statement."	-15.18

"""Republicans have a Marjorie Taylor Greene problem. Again,"" The Associated Press reports. House GOP leaders urged voters in Georgia's 14th Congressional District to pick someone else in the primary, wary of Greene's QAnon allegiance and documented history of racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-Muslim comments. After she prevailed in the primary, they pushed for her victory in the general election. She won.

Calls for Greene's ouster from the House started days after she was seated. And Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) said Wednesday he will introduce a measure to expel her, following new scrutiny of her social media history. CNN's KFILE got that ball rolling Tuesday.

Then the floodgates opened. Greene has called various deadly school shootings and the Las Vegas music festival massacre ""false flag"" events, questioned 9/11, and endorsed some foul QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories.

Marjorie Taylor Greene is into some seriously disturbed stuff here. The conspiracy theory she's promoting, ""Frazzledrip,"" is about Hillary Clinton torturing a baby and wearing its face as a mask. https://t.co/TpW382v9Bg — Will Sommer (@willsommer) January 26, 2021

Republican leaders are, once again, appalled. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Greene's posts are ""disgusting,"" have ""no place in our party"" and ""should be looked into,"" adding that ""QAnon is beyond fringe. I think it's dangerous."" Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) called Greene ""a RINO,"" or Republican in Name Only. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said through a spokesman that her comments are ""deeply disturbing"" and he ""plans to have a conversation with the congresswoman about them.""

In 2019, McCarthy stripped former Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) of all his committee assignments after he expressed support for white supremacists, AP reports. ""Greene was named this week to the House Education and Labor Committee."" CNN's Erin Burnett called that assignment doubly disturbing, given Greene's dismissal of school shootings, but said McCarthy knows some of the money Greene is raising off her outrages will go to the House GOP campaign committee.

Greene issued a weak and incredible non-denial denial of her social media activity, but the ""steady stream of revelations"" plus ""Greene's puzzling defense of herself should make Republicans wonder how long they can put up with this,"" Aaron Blake writes at The Washington Post. ""We tend to overestimate how much a politician like that can drag down their national party, but Greene's lack of remorse and candor reinforces how much of a loose cannon she could be moving forward.""

"(CNN) Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday slammed House Republican leaders for not doing more to rebuke GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia over her shocking rhetoric and past statements, saying the focus must be on leadership.

""What I'm concerned about is the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, who is willing to overlook, ignore those statements,"" Pelosi said at her weekly news conference, days after CNN reported Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians -- including Pelosi -- in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress. The statements were part a CNN KFile review of hundreds of posts and comments from Greene's Facebook page.

Greene is also facing criticism for a video of her confronting Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg before she was elected to Congress went viral Wednesday. And last week, other students who survived the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and families of the victims are calling for Greene's resignation, after comments surfaced that showed her agreeing with people who said the 2018 shooting was a ""false flag"" operation, remarks Pelosi called special attention to Thursday. The California Democrat also criticized Greene's placement on the House Committee on Education and Labor.

""Assigning her to the Education Committee when she has mocked the killing of little children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, when she has mocked the killing of teenagers in high school at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school -- what could they be thinking?"" Pelosi asked Thursday. ""Or is thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing? It's absolutely appalling, and I think the focus has to be on the Republican leadership of this House of Representatives for the disregard they have for the death of those children.""

Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California said he plans to offer a privileged resolution for the expulsion of Greene from the House, which would require a two-thirds majority to pass. And Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida said she is exploring the possibility of a resolution that would strip Greene of her committee assignments if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy doesn't remove her.

"In the wake of the recent deadly pro-Trump riot, the head of the U.S. Capitol Police is calling for ""permanent fencing"" at the Capitol.

Yogananda Pittman, acting Capitol Police chief, on Thursday argued ""vast"" security improvements at the Capitol must be implemented, over three weeks after a mob of supporters of former President Donald Trump breached the building.

""In light of recent events, I can unequivocally say that vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure must be made to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, back-up forces in close proximity to the Capitol,"" Pittman said.

The riot at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 left five people dead, and it occurred as Congress was meeting to certify President Biden's election win. The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday issued a terrorism advisory bulletin warning of a ""heightened threat environment across the United States,"" and it expressed concern that extremists may be ""emboldened"" by the attack on the Capitol.

Pittman's statement on Thursday came after she apologized to lawmakers earlier this week for the security ""failings"" surrounding the riot, acknowledging Capitol Police ""should have been more prepared for this attack"" and that ""we knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.""

In response to Pittman's statement calling for permanent fencing, CNN's Abby Phillip on Thursday wrote that ""one of the great things for D.C. residents and millions of visitors is the public space at and around the Capitol,"" and ""it will be a sad day if that goes away."" NBC News' Kasie Hunt also said that ""it is worth considering what we stand to symbolically lose by putting up a permanent fence around the People's House,"" while The Washington Post's Mike DeBonis criticized Pittman's statement, writing, ""Our elected representatives do not have to automatically do what the USCP brass demand be done in order to deflect attention from their own massive failings.""

"Acting U.S. Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman on Thursday called for the Capitol to have permanent fencing and back-up security to prevent another riot.

“In light of recent events, I can unequivocally say that the vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure must be made to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, back-up forces in close proximity to the Capitol,” Pittman said in a statement.

The Capitol police, along with other officials and organizations, have been reviewing the events of Jan. 6 and assessing the security of the Capitol building.

Police were severely outnumbered and the riot left five people dead, including a police officer.

While the security fencing has been up around the Capitol since Jan. 7, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said Thursday that she did not want fencing to become a “long-term fixture” in the city.

“As I noted earlier this week, even before September 11, 2001, security experts argued that more needed to be done to protect the U.S. Capitol,” Pittman said. “In fact, a 2006 security assessment specifically recommended the installation of a permanent perimeter fence around the Capitol.”

""We don’t want extra troops or fences to be a long-term fixture,"" Bowser said.

Pittman took control as acting police chief for the Capitol two days after the riot when the previous chief stepped down. Security in the city will continue to remain high with the upcoming impeachment trial of Trump in the Senate."	-15.18
"Trump and Rep. Kevin McCarthy discussed 2022 election during Florida meeting as Trump allies target pro-impeachment Republicans

Show Caption Hide Caption House sends Trump impeachment to Senate for second time House Democrats have sent the impeachment charge of “incitement of insurrection” to the Senate, kicking off the trial process. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Donald Trump discussed his plans to get involved in the 2022 congressional elections with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday, an indication the former president still has a hold on the GOP weeks after his supporters led a deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol.

At Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, he and McCarthy ""discussed many topics, number one of which was taking back the House in 2022,"" said a statement from the ex-president's office. ""President Trump’s popularity has never been stronger than it is today, and his endorsement means more than perhaps any endorsement at any time.""

Republicans lost control of the White House and Senate in the 2020 elections when Trump was atop the GOP ticket.

The Senate appears poised to acquit Trump in February when it holds an impeachment trial on a charge that Trump incited the riot. His allies stepped up attacks against Republican House members who backed impeachment – critics who may face Trump-backed challengers in Republican primaries next year.

Trump's approval ratings fell to record lows after the riot Jan. 6. More recent surveys show him regaining support among Republicans. A Morning Consult/Politico poll this week said 50% of Republican voters say he should play a ""major role"" in the future of the party.

A week after the invasion, McCarthy said Trump ""bears responsibility"" for the violence at the Capitol. Since then, McCarthy has taken a much softer tone toward Trump. ""I don't believe he provoked it, if you listen to what he said at the rally"" before the attack, McCarthy said a week ago. Thursday, his office released an upbeat statement about the meeting, saying Trump is ""committed to helping elect Republicans in the House and Senate in 2022.""

McCarthy called for ""a united conservative movement"" that can ""strengthen the bonds of our citizens.""

Impeachment has split Republicans and threatens divisive primaries that could undercut the party's prospects in elections. Allies of Trump have spoken about plans to target pro-impeachment House Republicans in 2022, attacks designed in part to warn GOP senators against supporting conviction at trial.

As Trump met with McCarthy, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., an outspoken Trump backer, traveled to Wyoming to denounce GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the most prominent of the 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump's impeachment.

Gaetz and other Republicans seek to remove Cheney from her leadership post – she is the No. 3 Republican in the House – and pledged to back a primary challenger against her next year.

Similar threats have been made to other House Republicans who voted for impeachment and to Senate Republicans contemplating conviction.

Trump has provided few details about how he plans to get involved in next year's congressional elections.

The Trump team said he would work with House Minority Leader McCarthy, R-Calif., and noted that Republicans picked up House seats in the 2020 election – though Democrats retained the majority and won control of the Senate.

Republicans in South Florida said McCarthy's visit is a sign that Trump remains a kingmaker in GOP politics, and the party needs him before the 2022 midterms.

""(McCarthy) is the first in a long line of notables you are going to see down here,"" said Peter Feaman of Boynton Beach, a member of the Republican National Committee.

Blair Brandt, who served as co-chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee last year and spearheaded fundraisers in Palm Beach, said the party needs money from donors, supporters and the party faithful who are going ""through the seven stages of grief.”

“Unity is the name of the game for Republicans right now,” Brandt said. “We need addition not subtraction.""

Republicans await the results of the Senate impeachment trial.

Conviction would require the votes of at least 17 Republican senators – and only five voted this week to even hold the trial. The 45 other Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., supported a motion saying the trial is unconstitutional because Trump is no longer in office. The motion failed, but the vote count showed Trump could be headed for acquittal.

If the Senate does convict Trump, it would then vote on whether to bar him from future office – action that would nullify another Trump presidential run in 2024.

Members of Trump's political team distributed a survey from John McLaughlin, a Trump campaign pollster, claiming that Cheney's impeachment vote ""makes her extremely vulnerable"" in next year's reelection bid.

Cheney has expressed no concern about reelection or her impeachment vote, saying Trump ""summoned this mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.""

From the border to the federal bench to raging political divisions: How Donald Trump's tenure has changed America

Other Republicans support Cheney, arguing the party needs to divorce itself from Trump if it's to have any hope of regaining control of Congress.

Members of an organization called the Republican Accountability Project aim to raise $50 million to defend the 10 House Republicans who backed impeachment. The group plans to speak out against GOP members who helped Trump try to overturn Joe Biden's election.

There is a ""hot civil war"" brewing within the Republican Party, said Sarah Longwell, executive director of the Republican Accountability Project, and members should try to resist Trump's effort ""to try to own the Republican Party.""

""It's bad news for the party, and it's bad news for the country,"" she said.

Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University, said she is ""astonished"" that so many Republicans believe a Trump-led party would be successful.

The party lost the presidency and control of the Senate before the violent insurrection led by Trump supporters, she said. In 2018, Trump-led Republicans lost control of the U.S. House, rendering McCarthy and his GOP colleagues to minority status.

McCarthy would be wise to urge Trump against primary challenges to ""disloyal"" Republicans, Brown said. Those kinds of races would divide the party further as it attempts to win back control of the House and Senate and make McCarthy the speaker of the House.

""McCarthy is trying to say, ‘Let's all support a big tent party, so we can win back the majority,’” Brown said. ""I doubt Trump will go for this because he is not a party player."""	-15.18
"A liquid nitrogen leak at a Georgia food packing plant killed at least six people Thursday and left three others hospitalized in critical condition, officials said.

Authorities responded to a report of burns at 10:12 a.m. at the Foundation Food Group plant in Gainesville, about 60 miles northeast of Atlanta, and within 10 minutes they had updated it to a hazardous materials response, Hall County Fire Service spokesman Zachary Brackett said.

Many evacuated employees and several other people were ""experiencing medical emergencies around the facility,"" Brackett told reporters.

The victims' names, ages and genders were not immediately disclosed.

""Preliminary indications are that a nitrogen line ruptured inside the facility,"" Foundation Food Group Vice President Nicholas Ancrum said.

""Those lost today include maintenance, supervisory and management team members,"" he said. ""Every team member is equally important to us and our hearts go out to their families.""

Hall County Sheriff Gerald Couch said he was moved thinking about those who were killed after having clocked in Thursday morning with no expectation of their fate.

""A lot of these folks that came into work did not have any idea of what would happen, nor did their families,"" Couch said. ""They're not in a profession that you would expect something like this to happen. But here we are. So that's why I ask you for all your prayers.""

Five people died at the facility, and another person died at the hospital, officials said.

In total, 12 people were initially hospitalized. One person died, three people were treated and released, three people were in critical condition and five others were in fair condition, Northeast Georgia Health System spokesman Sean Couch said.

One of those hospitalized is a firefighter who is expected to be OK and should be released Friday, Brackett said.

""Don't know much about the extent of the injuries beyond the conditions,"" Sean Couch said, ""but can say they're all respiratory in nature.""

The cause of the leak, which was not immediately known, was under investigation by the Hall County Sheriff's Office, the state fire marshal and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Brackett said.

Brackett also corrected early reports of a blast, saying, ""No explosion has occurred.""

A school bus took 130 employees to a church for medical evaluation, officials said.

Early reports about the accident had identified the plant as Prime-Pak Foods. But the facility, which processes chicken products, changed hands to Foundation Food Group on Jan. 1, officials said.

"Liquid nitrogen leak at Georgia poultry plant kills 6 A liquid nitrogen leak at a northeast Georgia poultry plant has killed six people and sent 11 others to the hospital

GAINESVILLE, Ga, -- A liquid nitrogen leak at a northeast Georgia poultry plant killed six people Thursday and sent 11 others to the hospital, officials said.

At least three of those injured at the Foundation Food Group plant in Gainesville were reported in critical condition.

Poultry plants rely on refrigeration systems that can include liquid nitrogen. Sheriff's deputies, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the state fire marshal were investigating the deaths and cause of the leak.

“It will be a lengthy process,” Hall County Sheriff Gerald Couch said. “It’s not something that’s quick.”

Foundation Food Group Vice President for Human Resources Nicholas Ancrum called the leak a tragic accident and said early indications are that a nitrogen line ruptured in the facility.

When leaked into the air, liquid nitrogen vaporizes into an odorless gas that’s capable of displacing oxygen. That means leaks in enclosed spaces can become deadly by pushing away breathable air, according to the U.S. Chemical Safety Board.

Gainesville is the hub of Georgia's poultry industry, which is the largest in the country. Thousands of employees work across multiple processing plants around the city and much of the workforce, like in many meat processing plants nationwide, is Latino.

Workers who had fled the plant were gathered outside when firefighters responded to the leak Thursday morning, Hall County Fire Department Division Chief Zach Brackett said.

“Once the units arrived, they found a large contingent of employees that had evacuated, along with multiple victims that were in that crowd that were also experiencing medical emergencies around the facility,"" Brackett said.

Beth Downs, a spokesperson for Northeast Georgia Health System, said five people died at the plant and one person died in the emergency room.

Hall County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Derreck Booth said officials were trying to notify family members of the deceased. No names were released. Ancrum said maintenance personnel, supervisors and managers were among the victims.

“Every team member is equally important to us, and our hearts go out to their families and communities who have suffered such a devastating loss,” Ancrum said.

Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department said Thursday that two of the six people who died in a liquid nitrogen leak at a northeast Georgia poultry plant were Mexican citizens.

The plant was known as Prime Pak Foods until January, when it became part of Foundation Food Group, a privately held company that Ancrum said has four Gainesville-area locations. The plant takes raw chicken and processes it into products like chicken fingers and individual chicken cuts for restaurants and food service operations, partially cooking them and then freezing them for later use.

Previous safety violations at the plant show no problems with the refrigeration system. The plant has been cited by OSHA for violations four times in the past 10 years, online records show. The most serious of those was in September 2015, when 28 violations were initially cited, including citations for failing to make sure machines were properly safeguarded when being maintained to prevent injuries. Two other citations in 2017 involved employees who had fingers amputated by machinery.

Four in every 100 meat processing workers suffered a recordable workplace injury in 2019, according to the most recent federal statistics. That number has been trending downward. A total of 12 food processing workers died in the workplace nationwide in 2019.

Fourteen American workers died from asphyxiation linked to nitrogen in 12 workplace accidents recorded between 2012 and 2020, according to OSHA.

Eleven people injured in the Gainesville leak were treated for respiratory symptoms at the hospital, including three who were in critical condition, health system spokesperson Sean Couch said. He said five were in fair condition and three were treated and released.

At least four firefighters were injured and taken to the hospital with what Brackett described as respiratory complaints. One firefighter remained hospitalized late Thursday.

“He’s doing well and he should be going home tomorrow,” Brackett said.

Brackett said the remainder of the plant’s 130 workers were taken by bus to a nearby church where hospital workers examined them for injuries.

Students were kept safe inside a nearby elementary school during the emergency, though the leak was contained and not airborne, Hall County school officials said. The shelter in place order was lifted Thursday afternoon.

"Cicely Tyson, the award-winning actress whose long career was filled with memorable portrayals of strong and vibrant Black women, died Thursday. She was 96.

Tyson got her first major break at age 48, when she landed the role of a sharecropper's wife in Sounder, earning her critical acclaim and an Oscar nomination. She won two Emmys, including best lead actress in a drama, for her starring performance in the hit 1974 CBS TV movie The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, and she won a third Emmy in 1994 for her supporting role in the CBS TV movie Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All. She also earned Emmy nominations for playing the mother of LeVar Burton's Kunta Kinte in the famed 1977 TV miniseries Roots, Loretta Scott King in King, and other roles.

In 2013, at age 88, Tyson won a best leading actress Tony for The Trip to Bountiful. She was honored by the Kennedy Center in 2015 for a lifetime of boundary-breaking performances, awarded an honorary Oscar in 2018, and in 2016, President Barack Obama gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.

Tyson was born in New York City's Harlem neighborhood in 1924 to immigrants from the Caribbean island Nevis. After they divorced when she was 11, she lived with her mother, a strict and religious woman who frowned upon her decision, after high school, to pursue acting. ""My mother told me I could no longer live in her house because I was determined to be an actress,"" she said in a 1990 interview. ""I said 'okay,' and I moved out.""

Tyson was married to jazz legend Miles Davis from 1981 until 1988, and their relationship, which started in the 1960s, was by all accounts tumultuous. Davis is believed to have been her only husband. ""Emphatic that her work was all that mattered, Ms. Tyson shielded the details of her private life,"" The Washington Post reports. ""A list of survivors could not immediately be confirmed.""

After playing prostitutes early in her career, Tyson vowed to be more selective. ""I wait for roles — first, to be written for a woman, then, to be written for a Black woman,"" she told the Entertainment News Service in 1997. ""And then I have the audacity to be selective about the kinds of roles I play. I've really got three strikes against me. So, aren't you amazed I'm still here?"" Her memoir, Just As I Am, was published Tuesday. Peter Weber"	-15.18

NEW YORK (AP) — Cicely Tyson, the pioneering Black actor who gained an Oscar nomination for her role as the sharecropper’s wife in “Sounder,” won a Tony Award in 2013 at age 88 and touched TV viewers’ hearts in “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” died Thursday at age 96.

Tyson’s death was announced by her family, via her manager Larry Thompson, who did not immediately provide additional details.

“With heavy heart, the family of Miss Cicely Tyson announces her peaceful transition this afternoon. At this time, please allow the family their privacy,” according to a statement issued through Thompson.

A onetime model, Tyson began her screen career with bit parts but gained fame in the early 1970s when Black women were finally starting to get starring roles. Tyson refused to take parts simply for the paycheck, remaining choosey.

“I’m very selective as I’ve been my whole career about what I do. Unfortunately, I’m not the kind of person who works only for money. It has to have some real substance for me to do it,” she told The Associated Press in 2013.

Tributes from two former presidents and from across the worlds of Hollywood and Broadway poured in, with many praising her careful approach to her career and activism. “She took pride in knowing that whenever her face was on camera, she would be playing a character who was a human being — flawed but resilient; perfect not despite but because of their imperfections,” wrote former President Barack Obama, who awarded Tyson the Medal of Freedom in 2016.

Former President Bill Clinton wrote online that Tyson “brought complex characters to life with dignity and heart, and humanity and depth, always remaining true to herself.” “She used her career to illuminate the humanity in Black people. The roles she played reflected her values,” wrote Oprah Winfrey.

Tyson’s memoir, “Just As I Am,” was published this week.

Besides her Oscar nomination, she won two Emmys for playing the 110-year-old former slave in the 1974 television drama “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.” A new generation of moviegoers saw her in the 2011 hit “The Help.”

In 2018, she was given an honorary Oscar statuette at the annual Governors Awards. “I come from lowly status. I grew up in an area that was called the slums at the time,” Tyson said at the time . “I still cannot imagine that I have met with presidents, kings, queens. How did I get here? I marvel at it.”

Writing in “Blacks in American Film and Television,” Donald Bogle described Tyson as “a striking figure: slender and intense with near-perfect bone structure, magnificent smooth skin, dark penetrating eyes, and a regal air that made her seem a woman of convictions and commitment. (Audiences) sensed... her power and range.”

“Sounder,” based on the William H. Hunter novel, was the film that confirmed her stardom in 1972. Tyson was cast as the Depression-era loving wife of a sharecropper (Paul Winfield) who is confined in jail for stealing a piece of meat for his family. She is forced to care for their children and attend to the crops.

The New York Times reviewer wrote: “She passes all of her easy beauty by to give us, at long last, some sense of the profound beauty of millions of Black women.”

Her performance evoked rave reviews, and Tyson won an Academy Award nomination as best actress of 1972.

In an interview on the Turner Classic Movies cable channel, she recalled that she had been asked to test for a smaller role in the film and said she wanted to play the mother, Rebecca. She was told, “You’re too young, you’re too pretty, you’re too sexy, you’re too this, you’re too that, and I said, `I am an actress.’”

In 2013, at the age of 88, Tyson won the Tony for best leading actress in a play for the revival of Horton Foote’s “The Trip to Bountiful.” It was the actor’s first time back on Broadway in three decades and she refused to turn meekly away when the teleprompter told to finish her acceptance speech.

″`Please wrap it up,′ it says. Well, that’s exactly what you did with me: You wrapped me up in your arms after 30 years,” she told the crowd. She had prepared no speech (“I think it’s presumptuous,” she told the AP later. “I burned up half my time wondering what I was going to say.”)

She reprised her winning role in the play for a Lifetime Television movie, which was screened at the White House. She returned to Broadway in 2015 opposite James Earl Jones for a revival of “The Gin Game.”

Her fame transcended all media. Apple CEO Tim Cook took to Twitter to praise Tyson as a “pioneer with purpose. Cicely Tyson’s talent redefined theater, film and television. Her courage, resilience and grace changed the entertainment landscape for generations to come.” Rihanna called her “a true legend.” Neil deGrasse Tyson called her “a force of nature unto herself” and Shonda Rhimes said “her power and grace will be with us forever.”

In the 1974 television drama “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” based on a novel by Ernest J. Gaines, Tyson is seen aging from a young woman in slavery to a 110-year-old who campaigned for the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

In the touching climax, she laboriously walks up to a “whites only” water fountain and takes a drink as white officers look on.

“It’s important that they see and hear history from Miss Jane’s point of view,” Tyson told The New York Times. “And I think they will be more ready to accept it from her than from someone younger”

New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael offered her praise: “She’s an actress, all right, and as tough-minded and honorable in her methods as any we’ve got.”

At the Emmy Awards, “Pittman” won multiple awards, including two honors for Tyson, best lead actress in a drama and best actress in a special.

“People ask me what I prefer doing — film, stage, television? I say, ‘I would have done “Jane Pittman” in the basement or in a storefront.’ It’s the role that determines where I go,” she told the AP.

Tyson made her movie debut in the late 1950s with small roles in such films as “Odds Against Tomorrow,” “The Last Angry Man,” and “The Comedians.” She played the romantic interest to Sammy Davis Jr.’s jazz musician in “A Man Called Adam.”

She gained wider notice with a recurring role in the 1963 drama series “East Side, West Side,” which starred George C. Scott as a social worker. Tyson played his secretary, making her the first Black woman to have a continuing role in a dramatic television series.

She played a role in the 1968 drama “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter” that was hailed by a reviewer as “an absolute embodiment of the slogan ‘Black is beautiful.’” In “Roots,” the 1977 miniseries that became one of the biggest events in TV history, she played Binta, mother of the protagonist, Kunta Kinte, played by LeVar Burton.

She also appeared on Broadway in the 1960s in “The Cool World,” “Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright” and other plays. Off-Broadway, she appeared with such future stars as Maya Angelou, Godfrey Cambridge and James Earl Jones in a 1961 production of French playwright Jean Genet’s “The Blacks.”

She won a Drama Desk award in 1962 for a role in the off-Broadway “Moon on a Rainbow Shawl.”

After her “Sounder” and “Miss Jane Pittman” successes, Tyson continued to seek TV roles that had messages, and she succeeded with “Roots” and “King” (about Martin Luther King) and “The Rosa Parks Story.”

She complained to an interviewer: “We Black actresses have played so many prostitutes and drug addicts and house maids, always negative. I won’t play that kind of characterless role any more, even if I have to go back to starving.”

She continued with such films as “The Blue Bird,” “Concorde — Airport ’79,” “Fried Green Tomatoes,” “The Grass Harp” and Tyler Perry’s “Diary of a Mad Black Woman.”

She won a supporting actress Emmy in 1994 for “Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All.” She was nominated for Emmys several other times, including for “Roots,” “King,” “The Marva Collins Story” “Sweet Justice” and “A Lesson Before Dying.”

In recent years, she was part of a panel discussion for “Cherish the Day,” an eight-episode OWN anthology series created and produced by Ava DuVernay. She played the mother of Viola Davis’ character on “How to Get Away with Murder.”

Tyson’s parents moved from the island of Nevis in the Caribbean to New York, where Cicely (her name was spelled early on as Cecily and Sicely) was born in 1924, the youngest of three children. When her parents separated, her mother went on welfare. At 9 Cicely sold shopping bags on the streets of East Harlem.

When she graduated from high school, she found work as a secretary at the Red Cross. Her striking looks prompted friends to advise her to take up modeling and that led to acting schools, theater, movies and television.

“My mother told me I could no longer live in her house because I was determined to be an actress,” she told an interviewer in 1990. “I said `OK,’ and I moved out.”

Tyson was married once, to jazz great Miles Davis. The wedding was held in 1981 at Bill Cosby’s home in Massachusetts, attended by show business notables. They divorced in 1988.

Tyson was never hard to spot. She tried to say no to wearing a terrifically large hat to Aretha Franklin’s 2018 funeral, only to be overruled by her designer. The hat would become a viral highlight.

“I never thought in my career that I would be upstaged by a hat! And I did not want to wear it,” Tyson said later. “I said, ‘I can’t wear that hat, I will be blocking the view of the people behind me, they won’t be able to see and they’ll call me all kinds of names.’ He just looked at me and said, ‘Put the hat on.’”

She came around, telling the AP she thought of the hat as homage to Franklin’s appearance at Obama’s inauguration.

"Just as the first phase of the massive Facebook data center in Newton, Georgia, was getting close to launching, the company announced it would add three more buildings to the campus.

Facebook said Thursday that the expansion would bring its total investment in the campus to $1 billion. The first phase, two buildings totaling about 1 million square feet announced in 2018, is expected to come online next year. The newly announced phase will add 1.5 million square feet.

The company has been expanding its data center capacity continuously to support the growth of its user base and the relentlessly growing number of images and video content they upload, as well as new products it’s been launching.

The next big workload for Facebook data centers is virtual reality.

Facebook announced its latest Oculus Quest 2 VR headset this week, making it both faster and cheaper than its predecessor. The company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg told The Verge that he expects to have sold 10 million VR units over the next few years.

As it races to build enough capacity to support growing demand, there’s pressure to build that capacity in a sustainable way. Also this week Facebook announced a goal to have invested in as much renewable energy generation capacity as the amount of energy consumed by its global operations.

In the Newton data center expansion announcement Facebook said it has invested in six new solar projects in the region that will bring 435MW of renewable energy to the local grid.

The expansion is the third Facebook data center construction project announced this year. In August the company announced plans to build a new campus in Tennessee. In June Facebook said it would build a data center campus in DeKalb, a town outside Chicago.

Facebook currently has seven operational data center sites in the US, including one in New Albany, Ohio, which was officially launched this February. The company launched two sites last year, in Los Lunas, New Mexico; and Papillon, Nebraska.

Three more Facebook data center sites in the US have been announced but not yet launched: Henrico, Virginia; Eagle Mountain, Utah; and Huntsville, Alabama.

In addition to its own sites, Facebook leases data centers from specialist operators like Digital Realty Trust and Cloud HQ.

Facebook has three operational data centers it has built and manages on its own in Europe, located in Sweden, Denmark, and Ireland, and one under construction in Singapore. Like in North America, the company also leases data centers in Europe and Asia."	-15.18

(Reuters) - Facebook Inc’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday the company would no longer recommend civic and political groups to users of the platform.

The social media company said in October that it was temporarily halting recommendations of political groups for U.S. users in the run-up to the presidential election. On Wednesday Facebook said it would be making this permanent and would expand the policy globally.

On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Ed Markey wrote to Zuckerberg asking for an explanation of reports, including by news site The Markup, that Facebook had failed to stop recommending political groups on its platform after this move.

He called Facebook’s groups “breeding groups for hate” and noted they had been venues of planning for the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Speaking on a conference call with analysts about Facebook’s earnings, Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that the company was “continuing to fine-tune how this works.”

Facebook groups are communities that form around shared interests. Public groups can be seen, searched and joined by anyone on Facebook.

Several watchdog and advocacy groups have pushed for Facebook to limit algorithmic group recommendations. They have argued that some Facebook Groups have been used as spaces to spread misinformation and organize extremist activity.

Zuckerberg also said that Facebook was considering steps to reduce the amount of political content in users’ news feeds."	-15.18
"chief Mark Zuckerberg said the social media giant is taking steps to reduce the amount of political content on its platforms and in its news feeds to channel users to more “healthy communities.”

“What we are hearing is that people don’t want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our service,” he said, clearly worn down by recent events. The commitment was vague. “We are still working through the best way to do this,” he acknowledged Wednesday on long a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings. “We will still let people engage in political groups and discussion if they want to,” he said.

The shift follows a tumultuous election process distorted by misinformation, defined by rising extremism and culminating in a deadly siege of the U.S. Capitol. Zuckerberg did not mention (nor, incredibly, did any analysts on the call ask) former President Donald Trump’s indefinite banishment from the site for inciting the violence and if or when he might be allowed back on. That appears to be the decision of an unusual oversight council of 40 individuals worldwide tasked with such decisions (and first reported on by the New York Times earlier this week.)

Zuckerberg insisted that only a small minority of content on the platform is political and the vast majority of users would like it to stay that way. “There has been this frenzy across society where a lot of things have become political and politics have been creeping into everything. And we have seen that people don’t want that. They come to connect with friends and family… We can potentially do a better job…”

The shift won’t impact Facebook’s bottom line, execs assured Wall Streeters, calling political advertising only a “low-single digit” revenue driver even in an active political season.

Facebook posted strong 2020 fourth-quarter number but noted headwinds this year which include an antitrust lawsuit by the FTC and most states and threats to repeal Section 230, that grants the Internet broad legal immunity and freedom to moderate content.

Zuckerberg declined to comment on the FTC but said, “On regulation overall, the point that I would to highlight is that it would be very helpful to us and the Internet sector for there to be clearer rules and expectations around some of these social issues, around how content should be handled, elections should be handled, what privacy norms the government wants to see in place. Because these questions all have tradeoffs.”

Free expression, safety privacy and social equity “are all very important and it is hard for a private company to balance those. It would be better to have clear guidance and clear rules for the Internet. So that is something that I am going to continue to advocate for.”

He reiterated he thinks Congress should in fact update Section 230, which is more than two decades old, “to make sure it’s working the way people intended.” The rule helped the nascent Internet grow and prosper, “so any changes should be thought through very carefully.”

The second theme of the call was bad Apple, which Zuckerberg slammed for new policies coming that will squeeze targeted advertising, which has helped boost revenue for Facebook and other companies. (Apple pumped out its quarterly results, which were stellar, after market close today as well.)

Zuckerberg accused the Tim Cook-led company of cloaking a highly competitive move as socially conscious. Separately, he noted a number of times how hard Apple makes it to compete in messaging since the iMessage app comes pre-installed on iPhones.

“I do think this is shaping up as…,” Zuckerberg started to sum up the Apple situation — before the conference call link dropped briefly and he lost the train.

Happier note, VR. Facebook, a leader in the field through Oculus, is building “one continuous ecosystem for spatial immersive computing,” he said, clearly enthralled with the technology. “Some of the things that we are going to be able to build with VR and AR are some of the kind of experiences I wanted to build since I was a kid.”"	-15.18
"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that the company is satisfied with policies regarding political and civic groups that it enacted for U.S. users during the 2020 election, and will extend them “for the long term.” In addition, Facebook intends to roll those policies out worldwide, and is also looking for ways to “reduce” how much political content users see in their news feeds.

The announcement came early on in Facebook’s fourth quarter earnings call Wednesday, as Zuckerberg discussed the company’s community goals for the coming year.

Zuckerberg began by boasting that Facebook helped “4 million people register to vote” in 2020 and saw tens of millions of people join communities that, Zuckerberg said, were beneficial to them. However, pointing to what he says is “an unfortunate decline in community participation” in the real world, Zuckerberg said he believes Facebook “can help.”

Zuckerberg added that “we need to make sure that the communities that people connect with are healthy and positive.” As part of this, he cited efforts to remove Facebook groups that violate rules against violence or hate speech, but also noted that “there are also a lot of groups that we may not want to encourage people to join even if they don’t violate our policies.”

This, Zuckerberg said, is why the company “stopped recommending civic and political groups in the U.S. ahead of the election,” a policy enacted around the same time it also banned all ads about politics and social issues.

“We’re continuing to find how this works,” Zuckerberg said, “and now, we plan to keep civic and political groups out of recommendations for the long term. And we plan to expand that policy globally.” In addition, Zuckerberg said, Facebook will also be “taking steps to reduce the amount of political content in news feeds.”

Zuckerberg didn’t provide a timetable for the global rollout of the policy or the change to news feeds. But citing “grassroots movements” and people who “speak out against injustice,” he clarified that Facebook doesn’t intend to prohibit participation in political activities or the formation of political communities and groups on the service.

“We want these discussions to keep happening,” he said, adding that “one of the top pieces of feedback that we’re hearing from our community right now is that people don’t want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services.”"	-15.18
“If someone wants to wear a BLM shirt in here, then cool. I’m not going to get offended about it. But at the same time, if someone’s not going to be able to wear something that is politically based, even in the farthest stretch of the imagination, that’s discriminatory,” said an employee, under the agreement of anonymity due to fears they could lose their job. “If we’re talking about equality, then it needs to be equality. If not, it’s discrimination.”	-15.18
"Finding out that an Instagram influencer you love holds a wildly different worldview than you do can often feel weirdly personal. Take Arielle Charnas, an OG fashion blogger at Something Navy, who just as the pandemic was sweeping New York City, announced to her more than 1 million Instagram followers that she’d pulled strings to get a Covid-19 test, was positive, then moved to the Hamptons with her family and nanny without quarantining first. Predictably, fans were furious.

Now imagine that the disappointing influencer had not only impacted your style or home decor but some of the most intimate decisions of your life, someone who you’d turned to for advice on motherhood, pregnancy, or postpartum depression. That’s what happened to thousands of moms on the internet last week when baby sleep expert Cara Dumaplin, known by her (admittedly brilliant) nom de plume Taking Cara Babies and her Instagram account of more than 1.3 million followers, was revealed to have donated multiple times to the Trump campaign.

Who is Taking Cara Babies, and why is she so important to parents?

On January 19 and 20, parenting forums and new mom group chats lit up after word began spreading on Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit that Dumaplin and her pediatrician husband had donated in total around $2,000 to various Trump campaigns in 2019 and 2020, according to Federal Elections Commission data. Parenting influencers like Jamie Grayson spread the screenshots on Twitter and Facebook, where they percolated among progressive parents. Author and screenwriter Bess Kalb, for instance, tweeted “OH MY GOD TAKING CARA BABIES IS MAGA.”

Facebook groups, along with Instagram direct messages, subreddits, group chats, or any one of the myriad ways people can connect online, have become a hugely significant part of many of our lives over the past few years, but especially for new parents. Real relationships are formed on these platforms between folks dealing with the same terrifying concerns and complicated questions, just as they would in any new mom’s group. It’s because the topics are so personal that what’s known as the “mom internet” or the “mommy blogosphere” can often feel intense, toxic, or unwelcoming to parents who aren’t well-versed in the parlance (and even those who are).

OH MY GOD TAKING CARA BABIES IS MAGA https://t.co/25fR2pNE6P — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 20, 2021

Moms who are active on social media told me they’d been part of what felt like “millions” of Facebook parenting groups since becoming pregnant: groups for working moms, groups for moms of a certain podcast fandom, Peloton moms, moms from the same synagogue, or moms of babies born around the same time. During the pandemic, the mom internet has become even more of a lifeline as mothers continue to shoulder the majority of the workload at home.

Taking Cara Babies’ star has risen directly alongside the importance of Facebook groups for new parents. For the many new parents who’d paid to take her online sleep courses, which range from $179 to $319, the Trump donation news came as devastating. “We put our trust in her when we were at our lowest and vulnerable,” says Katelyn Esmonde, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins and mother to a 12-week-old. “She made me feel like not getting my baby to sleep perfectly was okay. Being a mom is to feel like you are constantly failing, and she made me feel like I was doing a good job.”

Esmonde had signed up for her online newborn class, which cost around $75, and says the techniques helped her daughter’s sleep schedule significantly. “In my house, I can say something about what ‘Cara’ says and my husband knows exactly what I’m talking about,” she adds. But now, “it’s really hard for me to separate what I know about her now from the sleep advice that she gives. I can’t square that with supporting a candidate who put children in cages.”

Though Taking Cara Babies’ sleep training techniques are heavily borrowed from the well-known Ferber method, which stresses the importance of self-soothing, as well as Dr. Harvey Karp’s “Happiest Baby” books, Cara succeeded by meeting parents where they already were: Instagram.

“As you’re holding a baby, it’s easier to scroll through an Instagram video than to read a book,” explains Conz Preti, content director for Motherly and mom to a 3-year-old and 10-month-old twins. “The format is very parent-friendly — two- to five-minute videos that you can easily watch with a baby on you, or like, during a bathroom break.”

“Facebook groups are super important, and I think that’s also why they’re imploding,” Preti says. “I’ve been seeing over the last two years mom influencers blow up and Facebook groups implode, like when the [UES Mommas] Facebook had that huge implosion where people were calling out racists. I feel like parents have a lower tolerance for stuff like this. It wasn’t like this when I had my first three years ago.”

A year or two ago, a mom influencer could likely get away with avoiding political content on their channels, but the pandemic, the election, and the racial justice protests of 2020 have completely upended what we expect from someone with a large platform. Taking Cara Babies, unsurprisingly, steered far clear of anything remotely controversial in her content and courses, focusing specifically on her sleep training methods (and obviously, pictures of cute babies and inspirational quotes).

Preti has seen several of her own Facebook groups struggle to deal with how to approach potentially divisive conversations. “A lot of criticism in mom groups, when someone posts something political, is like, ‘We’re here to talk about breastfeeding, not politics.’ But motherhood is political. You’re building a path for children to have a future,” she says.

How Taking Cara Babies’ Trump donation turned into a familiar social media meltdown

What’s happening among followers of Taking Cara Babies is a microcosm of the conversation around the roles and responsibilities of celebrities and influencers writ large. The ill-advised social media habits of famous people over the course of the pandemic, including Charnas’s Hamptons escape, have made it increasingly difficult to justify the need for them at all. After a group of mostly white A-listers created a cringey video in an attempt to support Black Lives Matter, for instance, the Ringer’s Alison Herman asked, “What do we even want from celebrities right now? Are they capable of giving it to us?”

For parenting influencers, those responsibilities are infinitely greater. Charnaie Gordon is the woman behind the popular blog and Instagram account Here Wee Read, which reviews and recommends diverse and inclusive children’s books. As an influencer herself, she understands that speaking out on seemingly unrelated issues when you have a large platform can be complicated. “I can understand why people wouldn’t want to speak out. I didn’t always speak out on every single issue, because I’d be speaking out all the time,” she says. “But if you’re putting your business over human lives, is that right? It’s a fine line.”

It wasn’t just the Trump donations that angered fans, it was also Dumaplin’s avoidance of discussing the issue after the news broke — a misstep for influencers who trade on authenticity and accountability. “If somebody’s going to call you out, then I believe that you need to come out and make a statement yourself,” adds Gordon. “You have to face it head on, you can’t go about your normal course of business.”

“I think [Taking Cara Babies] raises a lot of questions about who gets to be the authority on parents, who gets to make money off of being a mom, and what values are being passed along as expertise,” says Hillary Dixler Canavan, restaurant editor at Eater, which is owned by Vox Media. Dixler Canavan posted about Taking Cara Babies on her public profiles, but she wondered, at first, whether by openly expressing anger about the Dumaplins’ donations that she was participating in “teardown culture” or whether her reaction was in some way sexist. Instead, she realized, “It’s like, ‘No, I’m not doing anything except saying that I’m pissed off.’”

In response, many parents say they’ll boycott Taking Cara Babies; some have also requested refunds. Other popular parenting Instagram accounts have made statements on their Stories to note that they disagree with Dumaplin’s beliefs. Dumaplin’s publicist emailed Vox a statement, writing, “Between 2016 and 2019, I made a series of donations (totaling $1,078) to the Trump campaign. As with many citizens, there were aspects of the Trump administration that I agreed with and some that I disagreed with.”

You can likely guess what happened next: Right-wing fans of Taking Cara Babies claimed that the public outcry was all just “cancel culture” rearing its head, and descended upon the people who had posted about their disappointment. “The replies on [my tweets] were about how I’m a terrible, disgusting person and that I’m committing a crime,” says Dixler Canavan, who had made a joke about how she would send the PDFs she bought from Dumaplin’s courses to friends to avoid giving more money to her business. “I was just blocking and ignoring.”

Then, the right-wing outlet the Federalist picked up the story. The resulting article is predictable; it frames Dixler Canavan as part of a “blue check” mob out to bully and dox an innocent baby expert. Yet “doxxing,” or revealing someone’s home address or otherwise personal information and thereby exposing them to potential harm, is misleading. People had posted the screenshot of the election campaign database, which included Dumaplin’s address (Dixler Canavan was not one of them), but the information was already public.

The end result was that Dixler Canavan, who as a member of the media wields a certain amount of influence in the public realm, but nowhere near as much as an influencer with more than a million followers and a lucrative business, was portrayed as an emblem of the “woke left establishment,” and was treated as such. For days, she was bombarded with tweets, emails, and Facebook messages, as well as some directed toward her bosses in an attempt to get her fired.

“Most of the comments I’ve gotten have been from men who I assume have never heard of this woman prior to the right-wing media ecosystem picking up this story,” she says. “I think it’s fairly obvious that this is people processing their feelings about Trump losing and loving the excuse to have a left-leaning woman to beat up on on Twitter.” Meanwhile, the “cancellation” claims appear to be unfounded: Dumaplin’s follower count has not changed.

Yet however disappointed progressive parents are feeling, Taking Cara Babies is not the root cause of America’s political problems, and a woman donating to the Trump campaign does not negate her ability to give useful advice on baby sleep training. “One of the things that I’m also sitting with is that I’m quick to not recommend her anymore, and yet I still buy shit off Amazon,” Dixler Canavan says. “It’s obviously true that Amazon has done far more harm than Cara’s $1,000 to Trump. I do not have the capacity to run every single person’s name through the FEC website to be a helpful resource for my kid.”

Being a terrified new parent is hard enough, after all. Whether or not Taking Cara Babies will continue to have a sizable fanbase after this — and she likely will — isn’t really the issue. It’s what kind of people we turn to for advice and guidance on some of the most personal aspects of our lives, and who profits from it. Under a Biden presidency, will influencers and celebrities be able to skate by without speaking out about political issues just because Trump is no longer in the White House, or will they be held accountable by the followers who make their livelihoods possible? If the Taking Cara Babies scandal is any indication, perhaps the answer is both."	-15.18
"Why Doesn’t Instagram Allow Links?

Out of all the social media channels, getting users to click through to your site from Instagram is the most difficult.

This is because Instagram doesn’t allow the use of links.

There’s only one place Instagram will let you use a link and that’s in your bio.

Compare this to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. which all give you the opportunity to post links to external sites using hyperlinks in your captions.

Instagram can therefore cause a lot of frustration for small businesses.

As a business, your goal might be to use social media to drive customers to your site.

But by limiting links, Instagram make it very hard to do this.

RELATED: How To Claim Your LinkedIn Company Page

So what is the reason Instagram doesn’t allow links?

It’s simple really. Instagram don’t want you to go anywhere.

They want you to stay on the site for as long as possible.

They want you to interact and engage with other users.

But most of all they want to show you ads.

And if you’re not on the site they can’t show you any.

Because ad revenue is Instagram’s main source of income.

So it does make sense that they don’t want users to leave – it’s not too original a business model.

The more ads they show people, the more money Instagram makes.

Using the Instagram bio link

The only place Instagram allow you to use a link is in your bio.

So you need to make sure you’re sending your users to the right place if they want to click through.

Most businesses link directly to their website’s home page.

Others link to a specific landing page – a blog piece or service page for example.

How to add a link to an Instagram bio

To add a link to your bio, go to your home page.

Go to the edit profile button and you can add a website URL there.

Type the URL you want to link to in the same place our website link is in the image.

This is what it’ll look like if you’re on mobile though.

"Mark Zuckerberg long allowed misinformation, hate speech, and conspiracy theories to fester on Facebook, framing his critics’ calls for stronger action as a threat to free speech, and never quite mentioning that the toxic content endemic to Facebook is good for his bottom line. “I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote for are saying,” Zuckerberg said in a Capitol Hill hearing in late 2019, “and judge their character for themselves.”

But, as everything that’s transpired since has made obvious if it wasn’t already, there’s a societal cost of that hands-off approach. And Facebook, like other social media companies, has been forced in recent months to take action. Over the past year, the social media giant has scrambled to stop the spread of fake news and conspiracies about the COVID-19 pandemic, implemented changes to its policies and algorithms to tackle harmful disinformation about the 2020 election and its incendiary aftermath, and even adopted a more aggressive approach to hate speech, lies, and extremism, including with its extraordinary decision, in the wake of this month’s attack on Capitol Hill, to indefinitely suspend Donald Trump. These measures have marked a shift from the laissez-faire approach Zuckerberg had long taken, yet they’ve tended to be too little, too late, and too temporary, treating the most glaring symptoms of the problem without addressing the underlying condition. Zuckerberg may have been able to curb some misinformation by banning political ads in the week leading up to the election, but the polarization and distrust his platform helped sow remains deeply embedded in American politics.

Maybe it’s a sudden surge of conscience, maybe it’s the threat of regulation, but Facebook will soon take its most significant step yet to reduce its harmful role in politics—by trying to retreat from that sphere altogether. Zuckerberg, whose company posted massive profits in 2020, announced on Wednesday that Facebook will aim to “reduce the amount of political content” on the platform and will no longer recommend civic and political groups—a practice that has helped draw users into partisan echo chambers. Political discussions will still be allowed, Zuckerberg said, but the company’s “theme” for 2021 is to be a “force for bringing people closer together.”

“We need to make sure that the communities people connect with are healthy and positive,” he wrote in a Facebook post after an earnings call.

Zuckerberg cited community feedback indicating that “people don’t want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services” as a motivation for the coming changes, but it’s likely that pressure from Washington has been as much, if not more, of an incentive. Democratic Representatives Anna Eshoo and Tom Malinowski last week blasted Zuckerberg and other tech leaders for “polluting the minds of the American people” and called for social media companies to “fundamentally rethink algorithmic systems that are at odds with democracy” in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot. “We recognize the recent steps Facebook has taken to crack down on harmful accounts such as those related to QAnon, by removing specific posts that incite violence and banning specific users,” the lawmakers wrote to Zuckerberg. “But content moderation on a service with more than 2.7 billion monthly users is a whack-a-mole answer to a systemic problem, one that is rooted in the very design of Facebook.”

Zuckerberg’s announcement Wednesday would seem to indicate he’s open to taking such action, but there’s good reason to be skeptical. While he said Facebook would commit itself to trying to “turn down the temperature and discourage divisive conversations,” he presented no real details as to how it will do so. And while it may be true that community feedback indicates users want a nicer Facebook, the company’s internal research suggests otherwise: when the platform recently tested algorithmic changes that reduced the visibility of “bad for the world” content, it found that user engagement went down with it. The so-called “nicer newsfeed” it temporarily fostered in America’s post-election powderkeg may have been better for society, but it likely wasn’t better for business. As long as harmful and divisive content contributes to Facebook’s growth, the company will have an incentive to take half-measures.

But perhaps the biggest obstacle to Facebook fixing what it helped break in American politics is that it may no longer be within the company’s means to do so. Zuckerberg long ignored, downplayed, and papered over the problems with his creation. Now, they’ve metastasized into something far larger and more difficult to control. Meaningful effort to address the systemic issues with social media is certainly welcome and long overdue. But taming the monster isn’t so easy. The changes are a “good step,” Malinowski wrote after Zuckerberg’s announcement Wednesday. “But we’ll see how it works in practice.”

"My college dorm was the first place I had reliable home internet access, and that was in part because my mom shared all the late 1990s and early 2000s parenting fears about the internet breaking our brains.

These worries were an extension of prior concerns about television: Don't sit so close! You'll hurt your eyes looking at a screen that long. How many hours today? That stuff rots your mind. You're getting manipulated by ads. Go outside. Go see your friends. No, you can't see an R-rated movie — those images will be in your brain forever. No, we're not watching that on a school night. No, you can't have one in your room!

With the internet, there was an extra element of suspicion: Don't use your real name or post a picture of yourself. Pedophiles could be literally anywhere! Don't go to sites you don't know. Porn could be literally anywhere! Don't believe everything you read, especially if it's not from a reputable source. Lies could be literally anywhere!

Two decades later, so many boomers that warned millennials to be careful on the internet seem to have forgotten all their own warnings. Their brains are broken, and that destruction is threatening to break our relationships, too.

The brain-breaking effects of the internet are by now well-documented. Author Nicholas Carr was a Pulitzer finalist in 2011 for his exploration of the subject in The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains, which remains a landmark work on this phenomenon. ""Over the past few years I've had an uncomfortable sense that someone, or something, has been tinkering with my brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory,"" Carr wrote in an Atlantic article that inspired the book. ""My mind isn't going — so far as I can tell — but it's changing. I'm not thinking the way I used to think."" The internet, Carr said, ""is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation.""

That article came out in 2008, when Twitter was just two years old, a silly place where you pointlessly announced your breakfast, and Instagram didn't exist. Facebook felt innocuous — Carr didn't even mention it in a story about the destructive mental effects of ""the Net,"" an unthinkable choice today. The risks our brains faced then, real though they were, look laughably meager now.

The attention span degradation Carr described has massively accelerated in the dozen years since his Atlantic story published, time in which social media and smartphone use has become ubiquitous. Our habitual distraction is debilitating; ""addiction"" is often neither too strong a word nor entirely metaphorical.

But it's not only that: The brokenness I'm describing is more than distraction. Carr focused on the medium over the message. ""[I]n the long run, a medium's content matters less than the medium itself in influencing how we think and act,"" he said in his book. I don't disagree, but what we're seeing now is that the content itself cannot be discounted as a potent force of mental disorder and relational discord.

There is so much content on the internet, and so much of it is bad. It is blasting in your face relentlessly. To navigate it well — to discern truth and lies, to parse one's own emotional and reflexive responses, to summon the mental energy to pay attention to credibility and incentives and the small, almost indescribable cues that might indicate whether a piece of content is to be trusted — is very difficult. It is especially difficult for those who have low digital literacy because they did not grow up using the internet.

Time and again I've had some variation of the following conversation with my mother, whom I am worried is drifting from garden-variety low-information folk libertarianism into whatever nonsense she happens upon in the weird dregs of YouTube.

Me: This is really sketchy; I don't think you should read it.

Her: What's sketchy about it?

Me: I can't even tell you if you can't see it. It's a bunch of little things. It's ... like look at that logo. You can't trust that.

Her: But why? Try to explain it to me.

Me: Just look at the logo! Look at the way it looks!

Her: ???

Then she sends the sketchy thing to another boomer, who immediately accepts it as gospel, and I know I've failed, but I don't know how I can better communicate what I see. I don't know how a few texts from me can compete, from hundreds of miles away, with YouTube video after YouTube video, each worse than the last, no matter how much YouTube claims to have fixed its algorithm. I don't know how 20 minutes on the phone a couple times a week can carry more weight than her daily grind of content consumption.

It's not just the logo. It's never just the logo. And it's all so obvious to me and invisible to her as to be ineffable for both of us. I don't know what to do.

This brain-breaking most often happens in connection to politics, particularly amid the sheer intensity of this year's political scene. There is ""a type of person who has become a trope of sorts in our national discussion about politics and disinformation: baby boomers with an attachment to polarizing social media,"" Charlie Warzel wrote in a New York Times report Tuesday. Warzel focused on social media's role in brain breaking — he spent several weeks in the ""information hellscape"" of two such boomers' Facebook feeds — but the phenomenon isn't confined to social media. It's our entire media climate. That also includes cable news, which has perpetual motion and emotional manipulation in common with the internet. The brain brokenness this climate produces has become a trope with good reason.

Whenever I bring up the subject of broken boomer brains to my peers, the response is the same: My dad is just like that. My mom does that too. I'm begging my parents to stop watching Fox. I'm begging my parents to stop watching MSNBC. I would break their TV if I could. I would set up parental controls on their internet if I could. I tried to get my stepdad off Facebook — I ended up having to unfriend him on there instead. They're always on Twitter. They're always on YouTube. They're always posting memes. They're always texting links. We can't have a conversation about politics anymore. They're always dialed up to 11.

And then, the gutting conclusion, repeated to me four times just in the last 24 hours: Well, at least it's not only my parents? At least there's not something uniquely wrong with the people I love.

None of this is to suggest my generation's brains are immune to internet breaking. But there are some important distinctions here — three in my observation — that give this a generational dimension.

The first (and this is based in data) is that younger generations are less likely to dose themselves daily with the poison of cable news, so that's one less source of content blasting. For those who consume cable news on a regular basis, the immersion becomes nigh impossible to break. Consider this account from an unnamed reader to conservative writer Rod Dreher on the subject of boomers, like his father, who have made cable news consumption a structural component of their lives:

These guys get up at 6 a.m. and watch Fox & Friends until 8 a.m. They go to work and watch Outnumbered during their lunch break at 12 p.m. They get home from work at 6 p.m. and watch [Fox pundits] Tucker [Carlson], [Sean] Hannity, [Laura] Ingraham, etc. until 11 p.m. All the while, they're on their phones or their laptops sharing memes with their buddies and arguing with strangers on social media. [...] It's ruining my dad's life. He's estranged from one of his brothers because they can't stop talking about politics. His doctor said Fox was a major contributor to his heart attacks, but he won't stop! And he's not the only one. [via The American Conservative]

This story mentions Fox, but it happens with other channels, too — CNN and MSNBC on the left, and OANN for the fringier right. Brains don't break in a single partisan direction. The medium is the same across the political spectrum.

And that brings me to the second generational distinction: the degree of innate understanding of the medium. I do not think my older family members understand the extent to which the content they encounter is tailored by algorithms to set their lizard brains on fire. Like the majority of their peers, as a 2019 survey showed, they probably don't understand an algorithm is involved at all. They insist they do understand, but their behavior tells me they do not.

They drift with the algorithm. They're statistically more likely to share misinformation and fail to identify content designed to take their money. They get on YouTube to watch a home improvement guide or some little history video about World War II, and three videos later they're watching conspiracy theories about how COVID-19 is going to make us communists, and this transition apparently sets off no alarm bells in their heads. I sit them down and say you should never accept a recommendation from YouTube. Turn off auto-play. Only watch what you deliberately choose to watch. And they say, yes, yes, that's a wise idea — and then they painstakingly click over to the conspiracy video four deep in the recommendations sidebar and deliberately choose to watch it.

I thought my own parents would be safe from all this because — thank God — they are not on any of the big three social media sites; they don't have cable; and their tech skills are limited. As it turns out, that's irrelevant. The internet is so user-friendly now it can break anyone's brain! YouTube and a few political email lists are all it takes. And now that this content history is established, my mom's search results are tailored accordingly. The brokenness is self-reinforcing.

The third distinction is real-life social networks, a distinction that has been grossly exacerbated by the isolation of the pandemic. The digital communication my friends and I have used to stay close these past nine months has been far from ideal, but it is much better than nothing. We can still talk. We can still ""gather"" to play games online and share joys and troubles.

Our parents have generally not managed that pandemic-time connectivity to their friends — if indeed they had close friends in the first place. A common thread in my discussions of broken boomer brains is a lack of intimate friendships and hobbyist communities. In the absence of that emotional connection and healthy recreational time use, this media engagement can become a bad substitute. The memes become the hobby. The Facebook bickering supplants the relationships. And it's all moving so fast — tweet, video, meme, Tucker, tweet, video, meme, Maddow — the change goes unnoticed. The brain breaks.

I'll close by again reiterating I do not mean this as a generational broadside. Boomers are not the only ones whose brains the internet is breaking. Though I do think the generational trope is significantly correct, I'm aware daily that my brain is also broken.

I am working to keep it from breaking further. I don't have apps for email, Facebook, or Twitter on my phone. I try to stay off Twitter all weekend and eschew news and political content all day on Sunday. Each morning, I do my damnedest not to let looking at my phone be the first thing I do. I track my phone screen time and set caps on the time I can spend on political sites I frequent and social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat. I mute any friend whose Instagram story is political, because I know the tiny adrenaline rush it produces will help to train me to check Instagram more often than I should. I unsubscribe from everything I can. I am determined to use what I've learned about my broken brain to keep my children's brains from being broken, too.

I am obliged to be on the internet all the time for my work, and I love it, but I hate it. More days than not I ignore my own best-laid plans to keep my brain as unbroken as I can. In a real sense, I took those early internet warnings to heart. What worries me so much is that too many of the very people who warned me seem to have forgotten their warnings entirely. They're not fighting the break. It seems like they don't even feel it anymore.

""Our parents' generation, no less than ours, was totally unprepared for the advent of digital technology and mass media,"" wrote the reader with the Fox News dad. ""They've been sucked into their screens like the rest of us."" They weren't physically abducted, as they feared we could be by a chatroom catfisher in 1999. But it can still feel like the people we know and love are gone."	-15.18
"In 1954, the limbic cortex was described by neuroanatomists. Since that time, the limbic system of the brain has been implicated as the seat of emotion, , mood, and lots of other mental and emotional processes. It is the part of the brain that is phylogenetically very primitive. Many people call it the ""Lizard Brain,” because the limbic system is about all a lizard has for brain function. It is in charge of fight, flight, feeding, , freezing up, and fornication.

The limbic system is much more powerful than we humans credit it to be. While seeing a patient this morning, there was wonderment on the patient’s part about how she relapsed. She had been doing everything “right,” but she had some time on her hands and mysteriously found herself in the liquor store and subsequently drinking. I do not for a second think that she was trying to be deceptive about her amnestic trip into the store to buy vodka. After she drank, she called for help and got back into treatment, but she was still mystified at her behavior.

What we know from a lot of research of the brain is that this type of unexplainable behavior happens all the time, and not just to addicts. It is just that addicts have more consequences for their actions in situations such as this. If one were to poll individuals about “unexplainable” behaviors, there would be a lot of stories to tell if people were being honest. How many times have we done something that we said we would not do, eaten something that we said we would not eat, or said something that we said we would not say? We all know that it is a very extensive list, and it happens every day.

The point to all of this is that 12-step recovery recognized (before the limbic system was described) that we all have this tendency to do what we don’t want to do, and we are powerless about certain behaviors. Understanding this automatic behavior allows us to surrender to what we cannot control. It frees us to do the next right thing by staying in the present rather than worrying about the future or being shamed and experiencing about the past. It takes practice. And more practice.

I always tell patients who are in recovery that if they feel like they are emotionally “in the groove” that it is likely they are in trouble. “The groove” is the comfortable place in your limbic brain that gets you into trouble. It is OK to experience the emptiness of life, the pain of the moment, and the discomfort of relationships. There is no need to anesthetize the discomfort. Working through it is the only path to growth and sobriety."	-15.18
"Facebook Inc. posted its fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, its first since the 2020 presidential election, when its role in the spread of misinformation became yet another flashpoint in the wider debate about Big Tech’s control over online speech.

Overall, the report did not reflect that controversy, as Facebook’s top-line numbers were as robust as ever. The social media giant reported earnings per share of $3.88 on revenue of $28.07 billion, beating estimates on both fronts. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $3.22 on revenue of $26.44 billion, according to a consensus estimate cited by CNBC.

Facebook’s global user base continues to tick upward, with 1.84 billion daily active users worldwide, compared to an analyst forecast of 1.83 billion. Monthly active users were 2.8 billion versus expectations of 2.76 billion.

But when broken out into regions, Facebook’s figures show continued signs of fatigue in the United States and Canada, where daily active users dropped from 196 million in the third quarter to 195 million in the fourth quarter.

Notably, this marks the second quarter in a row that Facebook saw its daily active users decline for the North American region. It made up for it, however, with gains in the rest of the world, perhaps most surprisingly in Europe, which rose to 308 million daily active users after three consecutive quarters of being flat at 305 million.

In a statement, eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said the decline could be a reflection of increased competition from newer, shinier social platforms such as TikTok. “Facebook didn’t experience similar weakness in DAUs in other regions, which indicates that users in the US and Canada are starting to move their social time and engagement elsewhere,” she said. “One logical destination is TikTok, which has grown rapidly in 2020 and has some of the strongest user engagement, in terms of time spent, among all the social platforms we follow.”"	-15.18

After Barack Obama’s decisive reelection victory in 2012, it looked as though the long process of conservative radicalization might be at a turning point. Democrats had trounced Republicans among all minority groups. The Republican National Committee, aware that the white GOP base constituted a shrinking share of the electorate, released a stunning “autopsy” report, diagnosing what had gone wrong. The document warned that the party was becoming closed-minded, that it needed to move left on LGBTQ issues, and that its stance on immigration would have to change.

By 2013 there appeared to be a burgeoning conservative reform movement—and I decided to write about it. I interviewed many of the reformers, including former Reagan administration official Bruce Bartlett and then conservative commentators Josh Barro and Ramesh Ponnuru. At the time, they were pushing for moderate immigration reform and for tentative moves away from the traditional right-wing insistence on tax and welfare cuts. Their efforts were fairly weak, I argued, and they faced “an extremely steep climb” to achieve influence. But, I concluded, “if in 2016 a Republican presidential contender can break free from the death grip of conservative Know-Nothingism and still succeed electorally,” the reformers “may well become very influential.”

Whoops.

Instead, the Republican Party drank even more deeply from the well of Know-Nothingism in 2016, nominating a racist game show host with literally zero political experience—and he won. Despite my caveats, the whole premise of the article was disastrously wrong. Now it’s time for an autopsy report of my own.

There were four factors that made a hash of my thinking. First, I failed to anticipate Republicans winning a blowout victory in the 2014 midterms. This seriously dented what little momentum reformers had.

Second, I didn’t realize what a disaster nominating Hillary Clinton in 2016 would be for the Democrats. She had an astoundingly difficult time putting away Bernie Sanders, who at the time was a barely known weirdo from the second-smallest state in the nation. By late 2015—long before the email story got going—her popularity numbers were deep underwater, where they would remain. She ended up being the second-most-unpopular major-party nominee in the history of polling, behind only Donald Trump himself.

Third, I failed to anticipate the depths of moral depravity to which the Republican Party would sink. I implicitly assumed that if Republicans continued to bleed support among younger generations, they would have to moderate their positions. But this assumed that they would play by the rules. In reality, they have compensated by cheating, using counter-majoritarian strategies like gerrymandering and voter suppression and stuffing the federal courts with right-wing ideologues who will rubber-stamp those maneuvers. Using these tactics, plus their undemocratic advantage in the Electoral College and the Senate, Republicans cling to power even as their elderly white voting base shrinks.

For my entire life, the Republican Party has been a geyser of awful policies and even worse moral behavior. Despite that, I gave into wishful thinking that perhaps, this time, they would turn things around of their own volition. Instead, the reformers I profiled have been sidelined by the party or have left it altogether. Barro now identifies as a neoliberal, while Bartlett is so disgusted with Republicans that he’s closer to Elizabeth Warren than to Mitt Romney. Ramesh Ponnuru, David Frum, and Reihan Salam are Trump skeptics, cast out in the cold by a party that approves of their president by a nine-to-one margin. It is clear that nothing will halt the spiral of Republican depravity aside from repeated, crushing political defeat.

That leads to my final mistake, which was a tacit overestimation of the strategic sense of the Democratic leadership. Republican extremism provided an opportunity that Democrats failed to exploit—in turn weakening the hand of reformers.

As I detailed in the article, Democrats had undergone their own reform process in the 1990s, when they ditched much of the New Deal liberalism that had defined the party for a generation, and moved to the center. But that was nearly thirty years ago, and it’s now clear that moderate thinking is dragging Democrats down. Millennials, the oldest of whom are nearly forty, are arguably the most left-wing generation of voters in American history. The Gen Z cohort coming up behind them is further left still.

Even so, Democratic Party leadership seems nearly incapable of shaking off the ’90s-vintage belief that the country is implacably conservative. Indeed, surveys show that both Republican and Democratic legislators over-

estimate the rightward slant of the average citizen. In 2016 the party elite united around Hillary Clinton, who had run to Obama’s right in the 2008 primary and lost. Even after Democrats won a sweeping victory in the 2018 midterms, the party leadership spent most of 2019 squashing calls for impeachment hearings.

However, there are signs that the Democrats’ learned helplessness is finally shaking off. As of this writing, the House has begun an impeachment inquiry over Trump’s attempts to blackmail Ukraine into investigating the Biden family. (No doubt the bill of particulars will have expanded by the time you read this.)

Elections are always strongly affected by chance events, and incumbents always have an advantage. But it’s also clear that both Donald Trump and the Republican Party are extremely unpopular, clinging to power only through cheating and a geographically warped constitutional system. When it comes to the psychosis that grips the Republican Party, the particular course chosen by Democrats matters a lot less than the party coming to believe and behave as though it has a majority behind it—as it in fact does. Only when Republicans are shut out of power for a decade or more will there be any hope for a successful conservative reform movement."	-15.18
"(CNN) Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress, a CNN KFile review of hundreds of posts and comments from Greene's Facebook page shows.

Greene, who represents Georgia's 14th Congressional District, frequently posted far-right extremist and debunked conspiracy theories on her page, including the baseless QAnon conspiracy which casts former President Donald Trump in an imagined battle against a sinister cabal of Democrats and celebrities who abuse children.

In one post, from January 2019, Greene liked a comment that said ""a bullet to the head would be quicker"" to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In other posts, Greene liked comments about executing FBI agents who, in her eyes, were part of the ""deep state"" working against Trump.

In one Facebook post from April 2018, Greene wrote conspiratorially about the Iran Deal, one of former President Barack Obama's signature foreign policy achievements. A commenter asked Greene, ""Now do we get to hang them ?? Meaning H & O ???,"" referring to Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Greene replied, ""Stage is being set. Players are being put in place. We must be patient. This must be done perfectly or liberal judges would let them off.""

After CNN reached out to Greene, her personal Twitter account posted a statement in which she did not deny that she liked posts and replied to comments but claimed that many people have run her Facebook page.

""Over the years, I've had teams of people manage my pages. Many posts have been liked. Many posts have been shared. Some did not represent my views. Especially the ones that CNN is about to spread across the internet,"" she wrote.

Greene did not specify whether she or a member of her team were behind the posts reviewed by CNN's KFile.

CNN reached out to Pelosi's office for comment multiple times but did not receive a response.

Though her tenure in Congress has only lasted a few weeks, Greene is already facing calls to leave the House for her role in fanning the flames of the Capitol insurrection earlier this month after she objected to the election certification process and falsely insisted that Trump would remain president.

After Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez called on Greene to be expelled from the House for her role in the insurrection, Greene condemned the violence at the Capitol and falsely accused ""Antifa/BLM terrorism"" and Democratic politicians of stoking the insurrection.

""I fully condemn ALL violence. The Antifa/BLM terrorism funded on ActBlue rests with Democrat accomplices like @CoriBush @Ilhan @KamalaHarris @AOC @timkaine & many more... Those who stoke insurrection & spread conspiracies have blood on their hands. They must be expelled,"" she tweeted

Last week Greene faced calls to resign from the survivors of the Parkland shooting survivors after Media Matters reported she agreed with comments calling the 2018 shooting a ""false flag"" operation, which refers to acts that are designed by perpetrators to be made to look like they were carried out by other individuals or groups.

CNN's KFile found additional comments from Greene where she called David Hogg, a survivor and activist, ""#littleHitler"" and spread a conspiracy that he was a ""bought and paid little pawn"" and actor.

Before she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene created a White House petition in January 2019 to impeach the House speaker for ""crimes of treason,"" citing Pelosi's support of so-called sanctuary policies that ""are serving illegals and not United States citizens"" and because Pelosi did not support Trump's border wall.

In one speech, promoting the petition, Greene suggested Pelosi could be executed for treason.

""She's a traitor to our country, she's guilty of treason,"" Greene says in the video, which she posted on Facebook at the time . ""She took an oath to protect American citizens and uphold our laws. And she gives aid and comfort to our enemies who illegally invade our land. That's what treason is. And by our law representatives and senators can be kicked out and no longer serve in our government. And it's, uh, it's a crime punishable by death is what treason is. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason.""

In another Facebook Live broadcast from inside Pelosi's office on February 22, 2019, Greene suggested the House speaker will ""suffer death or she'll be in prison"" for her ""treason."" Notably, Greene never mentions a trial. In another broadcast from later that day, she suggested California Rep. Maxine Waters was ""just as guilty of treason as Nancy Pelosi.""

In the comments of her Facebook posts, often promoting the petition, Greene liked a comment that said ""through removal or death, doesn't matter, as long as she goes,"" referring to Pelosi, and another that encouraged Greene to ""beat Pelosi's ass.""

The petition for Pelosi's impeachment and removal for treason amassed over 420,000 signatures as of January 2021.

On social media, Greene portrays herself as an opponent to political violence and casts Democrats as the real instigators of political violence, either real or imaginary, who get away with threatening calls for violence.

""Do any of you remember a day when talking about assassinating the President resulted in getting arrested? As in arrested in real life, not FB [Facebook] jail. When was that? Pre-2016 I think, right??? But if you are a conservative that's a different story!"" wrote Greene in 2019

While Greene notes in Facebook posts that she disavows and denounces violence, within the comment sections of Greene's Facebook page, commenters frequently cheer for politicians to be executed by hanging or firing squad.

Elsewhere on her Facebook page, Greene liked comments that advocated to ""arrest"" Obama and former Secretary of State John Kerry and one comment that said , ""HANG that bitch,"" referring to either Obama or Kerry or possibly both of them. She also liked a comment that urged for ""civil war 2.0"" to begin.

Greene, who has embraced and spread the baseless conspiracy theory about a ""deep state"" working to usurp Trump's agenda, suggested in Facebook posts that FBI agents disloyal to Trump were traitors."	-15.18
"Note: This piece describes in some detail a false claim of graphic child abuse.

In another newly uncovered 2018 Facebook post, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) endorsed a conspiracy theory that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was videotaped murdering a child during a satanic ritual and then ordered a hit on a police officer to cover it up. She also liked a meme claiming that some of her now-Democratic congressional colleagues have used the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for human trafficking, pedophilia, and organ harvesting.

Greene is a former right-wing commentator who is now a Republican member of Congress. She has received heavy criticism for her recently uncovered endorsements of the conspiracy theories that the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, were staged false flags. Greene is also a QAnon and 9/11 conspiracy theorist who has promoted anti-Muslim attacks and a conspiracy theory that Jewish people are trying to take over Europe through immigration.

Greene is also a backer of the violent and absurd “Frazzledrip” conspiracy theory, which is linked to QAnon and Pizzagate and essentially claims that Hillary Clinton and former aide Huma Abedin sexually assaulted a child, filleted her face, wore her face like a mask, and then drank her blood as part of a satanic ritual to ingest something called adrenochrome.

The Washington Post wrote in December 2018 that the conspiracy theory was heavily spread on YouTube and “a Washington Post review found that dozens of videos alleging or discussing these false claims remain online and have been viewed millions of times over the past eight months. YouTube’s search box highlighted the videos when people typed in seemingly innocuous terms such as ‘HRC video’ or ‘Frazzle.’”

Greene endorsed the conspiracy theory on Facebook in May 2018. She posted a picture of the mother of slain New York Police Department Detective Miosotis Familia with former President Donald Trump. A commenter wrote: “This is the mother of a NYPD officer who watched a horrific video seized on anthony weiners laptop of huma and hillary filleting a childs face. This was another hillary hit.” Greene liked that comment and replied: “Yes Familia.” She added in another comment: “I post things sometimes to see who knows things. Most the time people don’t. I’m glad to see your comment. I’ve decided it’s time to start doing a lot more videos and engage further in the fight. Most people honestly don’t know so much. The [mainstream media] disinformation warfare has won for too long!”"	-15.18

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wrote a bizarre Facebook post that echoed QAnon conspiracy theorists and falsely claimed that the real and hidden culprit behind the disaster was a laser from space triggered by some nefarious group of people.

Greene’s post, which hasn’t previously been reported, is just the latest example to be unearthed of her embracing conspiracy theories about tragedies during her time as a right-wing commentator. In addition to being a QAnon supporter, Greene has pushed conspiracy theories about 9/11, the Parkland and Sandy Hook school shootings, the Las Vegas shooting, and the murder of Democratic staffer Seth Rich, among others.

Greene also has a history of pushing anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic remarks.

CNN’s Em Steck and Andrew Kaczynski recently reported that on her Facebook page, “Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and the Republican Party have done little to stop Greene’s rising profile. During the 2020 campaign, the National Republican Congressional Committee added her to its “Young Guns” fundraising and recruitment program. In November, after Greene was elected, McCarthy defended her by falsely claiming that she’d denounced her QAnon views. And Republicans have selected Greene to be a member of the House Budget Committee and the House Committee on Education and Labor. (A spokesperson for McCarthy recently told Axios: “These comments are deeply disturbing and Leader McCarthy plans to have a conversation with the Congresswoman about them.”) One of Greene’s conspiracy theories directly targets McCarthy’s state.

The Camp Fire was a horrific California wildfire that started on November 8, 2018, and, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, “burned a total of 153,336 acres, destroying 18,804 structures and resulting in 85 civilian fatalities and several firefighter injuries. The Camp Fire is the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history.” After an investigation, the department “determined that the Camp Fire was caused by electrical transmission lines owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electricity (PG&E) located in the Pulga area.” Scientists have noted that climate change has worsened wildfires in places like California.

Conspiracy theorists have pushed other explanations for the Camp Fire, especially on social media. One theory, which has been promoted by QAnon followers, falsely posits that a nefarious entity used laser beams or a similar instrument to start the fire for financial profit or to clear space for California’s high-speed rail system.

Rep. Greene is a proponent of the Camp Fire laser beam conspiracy theory. She wrote a November 17, 2018, Facebook post -- which is no longer available online -- in which she said that she was speculating “because there are too many coincidences to ignore” regarding the fire, including that then-California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) wanted to build the high-speed rail project and “oddly there are all these people who have said they saw what looked like lasers or blue beams of light causing the fires.” She also speculated that a vice chairman at “Rothschild Inc, international investment banking firm” was somehow involved, and suggested the fire was caused by a beam from “space solar generators.”

Greene added: “If they are beaming the suns energy back to Earth, I’m sure they wouldn’t ever miss a transmitter receiving station right??!! I mean mistakes are never made when anything new is invented. What would that look like anyway? A laser beam or light beam coming down to Earth I guess. Could that cause a fire? Hmmm, I don’t know. I hope not! That wouldn’t look so good for PG&E, Rothschild Inc, Solaren or Jerry Brown who sure does seem fond of PG&E.”"	-15.18
"(CNN) Students who survived the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and families of the victims are calling for Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation, after comments surfaced that showed her agreeing with people who said the 2018 shooting was a ""false flag"" operation.

Seventeen people, including 14 students, were killed in the shooting, which ignited a nationwide movement for stricter gun control laws spearheaded by March For Our Lives, a group started by survivors of the shooting.

""(T)he shooting at our school was real. Real kids died and our community is still grieving today,"" the Parkland chapter of the organization wrote in a tweet directed at Greene. ""You should be ashamed of yourself and resign from congress. Conspiracy theorists don't deserve a seat in the people's house.""

CNN has reached out to Greene's office for comment.

Greene's comments came to light in a report by the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America . The article points to a Facebook post Greene made in 2018, sharing an article about the $8,700 monthly pension given to the school resource deputy who failed to enter the school as the shooting was ongoing.

According to screenshots captured by MMFA, Greene agreed with commenters who said the shooting was a ""false flag"" operation, a conspiracy theory that the shooting was set up or designed to look like it was carried out by another individual or group. ( Similar lies have been perpetuated about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, prompting the harassment of the victims' families.)

One comment on Greene's post read, ""It's called a pay off to keep his mouth shut since it was a false flag planned shooting.""

""Exactly,"" Greene wrote in response, per MMFA's screenshots.

Another commenter referred to the pension as a ""(k)ick back for going along with the evil plan,"" to which Greene responded, ""My thoughts exactly!! Paid to do what he did and keep his mouth shut.""

Facebook removed the comments for violating its policies after the MMFA report was published, according to a Facebook spokesperson.

Margarita Lasalle, right, the budget keeper, and Joellen Berman, the guidance data specialist, look on at the memorial in front of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as teachers and staff are allowed to return to the school for the first time since the mass shooting on campus on February 23, 2018 in Parkland, Florida.

'My daughter and 16 others were murdered that day'

Survivors of the shooting and their family members have since condemned Greene and called for her to step down.

David Hogg, a former Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student and activist, wrote on Twitter that he had ""one message"" for Greene.

""Apologize Now or continue to spread these conspiracies and we will be sure to make the next 2 years of your life not only your last in Congress but a living hell as well.""

Hogg added that advocates would ""also accept your resignation in place of an apology.""

Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was killed in the shooting, tweeted at Greene after her comments came to light, writing, ""Will you be resigning? For the good of this country, you should. Parkland was not a made up false flag event. My daughter and 16 others were murdered that day.""

Greene did not address her past comments in a statement posted on Twitter after the MMFA story came to light. She instead argued against ""'gun-free' school zones"" saying she was once ""locked in a classroom in 11th grade"" due to a student who brought guns to her high school and ""personally"" understood students' fears.

She also criticized the deputy, writing he ""allowed children to be left defenseless against an active shooter. When he was supposed to protect them, he was a coward and refused to go in. He allowed 17 people to die.""

In a separate tweet Thursday , Greene called MMFA ""communist bloggers"" who ""run the same playbook of lies and smears on people they feel threatened by.""

Cameron Kasky, another former student, wrote of her statement, ""This, beyond being a stupid and meaningless message, does not in any way address her calling it a false flag. Now she's playing full-on gaslight. Don't let her.""

Guttenberg said in response, ""You are a fraud who must resign. Be prepared to meet me directly in person to explain your conspiracy theory, and soon.""

Other groups calling for gun control, like Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action, also called for Greene's resignation.

""Dangerous conspiracy theorists who peddle disinformation like Rep. Greene ever further damage the credibility of Congress,"" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, said in a statement. ""Taylor Greene's lies traumatize the survivors of shooting tragedies and put their safety in danger. She must resign immediately.""

Greene has history of spreading conspiracy theories

Greene, a newly elected congresswoman representing Georgia's 14th District, has displayed an affinity for conspiracy theories in the past, including QAnon , whose adherents believed former President Donald Trump was fighting a secret war against a cabal of Satan-worshiping child abusers who were running the government.

Greene backed away from the conspiracy theory during her campaign , telling Fox News last August that QAnon ""wasn't part of my campaign"" and that she ""chose another path"" when she ""started finding misinformation.""

MMFA also reported on another Facebook post by Greene, in which she said she was ""told that Nancy Pelosi tells Hillary Clinton several times a month that 'we need another school shooting' in order to persuade the public to want strict gun control.""

CNN's KFILE has previously reported on Greene's history of peddling baseless conspiracy theories like 'Pizzagate,' a precursor to Qanon. KFILE also reported Greene once worked for a conservative blog that once questioned if the shooting in Parkland was a ""massive false flag.""

At the time, Greene told CNN she wore ""attacks"" from the media as a ""badge of honor,"" but did not address the past blog posts."	-15.18
"Video resurfaced on Wednesday shows Marjorie Taylor Greene harassing David Hogg in 2018.

Greene is seen following the Parkland shooting survivor as he walks toward the Capitol.

She also called him a ""coward"" and said his silence is evidence he can't defend his gun-control stance.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

A recently-resurfaced video shows Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene harassing Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg on Capitol Hill shortly after the 2018 attack, calling him a ""coward.""

Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was among the 17 people killed in the school shooting, shared the video on Twitter on Wednesday.

The video shows Greene tailing Hogg as he walked toward the Capitol in March 2018 to advocate for gun control, just weeks after he survived the February 14 shooting. Hogg was 17 years old at the time. Greene was elected to Congress in November 2020.

The footage shows Greene peppering Hogg with questions, asking why he's using kids to push his anti-gun agenda and telling him that there wouldn't be school shootings if more people carried guns.

Hogg ignores Greene's questions and continues walking in silence.

""Why are you using kids as a barrier? Do you not know how to defend your stance? Look, I'm an American citizen, I'm a gun owner. I have a concealed carry permit, I carry a gun for protection for myself, and you are using your lobby and the money behind it and the kids to try to take away my Second Amendment rights,"" Greene says in the video.

""You don't have anything to say for yourself? You can't defend your stance?"" she continues.

""You know, if school zones were protected with security guards with guns, there would be no mass shootings at schools. Do you know that? The best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun. And yet you're attacking our Second Amendment. And you have nothing to say. No words.""

Eventually Greene stops following Hogg and turns to address the camera, complaining about how Hogg secured meetings with lawmakers while she didn't get one. She also accuses Hogg, without evidence, of being paid to lobby for gun control.

""Guess what, I'm a gun owner, I'm an American citizen, and I have nothing. But this guy with his George Soros funding and his major liberal funding has got everything. I want you to think about that. That's where we are. And he's a coward. He can't say one word because he can't defend his stance,"" Greene says.

Hogg responded to the video going viral on Wednesday on Twitter, saying it's an example of the kind of intimidation fellow gun-violence survivors face while trying to prevent other mass shootings.

""As we fight for peace, we also face massive amounts of death threats and armed intimidation simply for not wanting our friends to die anymore,"" Hogg said. ""This is not the country we should be and it's not the country we have to be.""

He added: ""Part of the reason we were so calm with [Greene] harassing us was because we have been through similar stuff so many times before. It's just this time it was on video — and they're in Congress now. What you see in that video is about 0.1% of what we go through in a year.""

Insider has contacted Greene for comment.

Greene is one of the most controversial Republican to be elected to Congress in 2020, thanks to her support in the past for the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.

Last week, school shooting survivors called on Greene to resign when a report found that she agreed with a social media post that claimed the Parkland shooting was staged.

A CNN report published on Tuesday found that Greene had previously shown support for assassinating Democratic leaders like former President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Earlier this week the office of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he would speak to Greene about her ""disturbing"" social-media comments."	-15.18
"WASHINGTON — After last week's deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, members of Congress are expressing something once unthinkable: that some of their own colleagues may be endangering their lives. Not in a rhetorical sense, but in a direct and immediate way.

""It's the most poisonous I've ever seen,"" Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said in an interview. ""There's the overall sense that maybe if some of them have guns — and likely the ones who are more into conspiracy theories and QAnon with the pedophilic satanic rings — are we safe from them?""

Since the deadly riot Jan. 6, lawmakers have suggested — not, so far, backed up by evidence — that far-right colleagues may have helped plan or guide the attack. There are particular concerns about some newly elected members who have espoused extremist views, including comments supportive of the QAnon lie that accuses perceived enemies of Trump of being part of a child-abusing cult.

One House freshman is pushing to carry firearms on Capitol grounds, and another recounts being armed during the attack, further putting their colleagues on edge. With the support of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., security officials have installed metal detectors outside the House floor, causing tension among some Republicans and effectively suggesting that members themselves may pose a danger.

Democrats are outraged at 147 Republicans who they say abided by the rioters' calls and voted to overturn the election results even after the violent attack, which left five people dead and forced lawmakers to hide in their offices and safe rooms.

But, Beyer said, the issue ""that has the greater emotional impact is the sense that there's perhaps actual physical danger from our colleagues.""

With lawmakers traumatized, hundreds of members of the National Guard sleeping in congressional hallways and warnings from authorities about continued threats, suspicion and rumor are running rampant.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has said she feared for her life, in part because she doubted the motives of unnamed colleagues who were sheltering with her.

""There were QAnon and white supremacist sympathizers, and frankly white supremacist members of Congress, in that extraction point who I have felt would disclose my location and would create opportunities to allow me to be hurt, kidnapped, etc.,"" Ocasio-Cortez, a highly visible progressive and frequent target of conservative media, said in a speech Tuesday streamed live on Instagram.

Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., has said she saw lawmakers holding tours around the Capitol the day before the attack, which she said she believes may have been part of a ""reconnaissance"" effort for the rioters. There is no evidence of such wrongdoing, and Sherrill has not publicly disclosed any names. But she and over 30 other Democrats have signed on to a letter asking authorities to investigate the claim.

""I was flat on the ground as other members were calling loved ones because they thought that might be the last phone call they made,"" Sherrill said Wednesday on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show."" ""To imagine that colleagues of mine could have aided and abetted this is incredibly offensive, and there is simply no way they can be allowed to continue to serve in Congress.""

Raising the temperature further is the threat of Covid-19, as members continue to contract the virus amid resistance among some Republican lawmakers to wearing masks.

Several members have tested positive for Covid-19 since the attack, including Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., 75, a cancer survivor, who blamed GOP colleagues for refusing to wear masks while sheltering in tight quarters during the attack. Other Democrats have made similar accusations.

""It's very disturbing that [it's] this combined threat — the threat from within and the threat from without,"" said Rep. Ann McLane Kuster, D-N.H.

A trio of GOP freshmen have drawn particular attention and concern from colleagues: Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.

Some lawmakers have suggested that Boebert, a Second Amendment advocate and past QAnon sympathizer, may have deliberately revealed Pelosi's location during the attack on Twitter. Boebert also tweeted ""Today is 1776"" the morning of the rally.

The concerns are not limited to Democrats. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., called Boebert ""culpable"" in the attack in an interview with National Journal, citing her tweet about Pelosi.

Boebert has denied any involvement in the assault, including claims that she sought to draw attention to Pelosi's whereabouts, saying her tweet was posted after Pelosi had moved on and did not mention her secure location. In a statement, she told NBC News that she is ""not a follower or believer of QAnon and I have repeatedly disavowed it.""

Boebert has also resisted new metal detectors in her high-profile push to carry guns through the Capitol. Members are not allowed to have guns on the House floor.

The metal detectors have become a culture war flashpoint; Boebert and other Republicans refuse to go through them at times. Pelosi announced Wednesday night that she would fine members who evade the metal detectors up to $10,000, writing in a statement that ""it is tragic that this step is necessary, but the Chamber of the People's House must and will be safe.""

Cawthorn, who spoke at a pro-Trump rally in Washington before the Capitol siege, has said he was carrying a firearm during the riot.

""Congressman Cawthorn exercises his 2nd Amendment rights as well as privileges accorded to him as a member of Congress,"" his spokesman, Micah Bock, said in an email. ""Congressman Cawthorn seeks to abide by all known Capitol Police regulations.""

Cawthorn has also faced scrutiny for his call to ""lightly threaten"" lawmakers who did not support overturning the election results. A spokesman said he meant finding primary challengers for those lawmakers. In October, his campaign website accused a reporter of taking a job ""to work for non-white males,"" like Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who it said aim to ""ruin white males running for office.""

Cawthorn has denounced last week's violence and denied any racist intentions in his comments. Bock said any member uncomfortable around Cawthorn ""hadn't met him yet"" and would find him ""friendly and amiable.""

Greene, who has clashed with members over wearing masks, supported Trump's efforts to overturn the election and explicitly promoted QAnon more than any other national elected figure. She once described Trump's presidency as a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles out.""

Greene's spokesman, Nick Dyer, denied suggestions that she supports QAnon. He said the allegation that she had endangered colleagues by not wearing a mask in a safe room during the attack was ""ridiculous,"" saying she had tested negative for Covid-19 two days before.

""She has nothing to do with QAnon,"" Dyer said. ""She doesn't support it. She doesn't follow it. She believes it's disinformation.""

It's hard to find historical precedent for this level of visceral worry about danger among lawmakers.

Joanne Freeman, who is a historian at Yale University and the author of ""The Field of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War,"" likened the atmosphere to the decades before the Civil War, when fistfights often broke out on the House floor and a Northern senator was caned by a Southern House member.

Freeman cautioned against drawing too many direct parallels, as it was a more violent time in America across the board. But, she said, the violence in Congress both reflected and encouraged violence outside its walls: It took place as slave owners were brutalizing Black Americans and engaging in limited warfare with abolitionists in the territories.

""Everything that happens in the Capitol and Congress has a symbolic representative nature, and that's some of what we saw this week and some of what we're responding to,"" Freeman said.

Two lawmakers, Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., and freshman Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich., both claim that some GOP colleagues voted to overturn the election results or against impeaching Trump out of fear that their families' lives may be put in danger. Other Republicans urged against impeachment in part to avoid inciting further violence, effectively conceding that pro-Trump extremists pose a continuing threat.

Meijer said in an appearance on MSNBC that he and other members were buying body armor.

""It's sad that we have to get to that point, but our expectation is that someone may try to kill us,"" he said.

Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University who studies how democracies slide into authoritarianism, said the atmosphere was disturbingly similar to those in governments in which dissident politicians live in fear of death threats, including fears that pro-regime extremists might target them with tacit support from government leaders or state security.

""In the atmosphere of threat, a lot of people quit,"" she said. ""By the time you're at the endgame, you only have the people who say they refuse to be bullied and will risk their lives and those that are so bullied they can't even open their mouths.""

"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is setting up a new test for House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy.

Why it matters: The freshman Republican from Georgia made a series of bizarre and outlandish remarks before her time in Congress that rival former Rep. Steve King's talk of white supremacy.

What’s happening: The latest round of Greene comments, pulled from archives of her Facebook page, show the congresswoman promoting an outlandish, QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton cutting off and donning the face of a child.

That comment was reported by the progressive group Media Matters for America, which previously noted her endorsements of claims that 9/11 was perpetrated by the American government, and that the Parkland school shooting was staged.

CNN reported Tuesday that Greene had floated executing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for treason, and “liked” Facebook comments suggesting the execution of FBI agents.

What they're saying: Mark Bednar, a spokesperson for McCarthy, told Axios he is aware of the comments and will discuss them with Greene.

""These comments are deeply disturbing and Leader McCarthy plans to have a conversation with the Congresswoman about them,"" Bednar said in an emailed statement.

Between the lines: When McCarthy stripped King, then a Republican congressman from Iowa, of his committee assignments in 2019, he signaled he was setting a threshold for the public comments of his caucus members.

King had wondered publicly why terms like “white nationalism” and “white supremacy” had suddenly “become offensive.”

Whether Greene’s comments cross the same line remains to be seen.

In an interview with The Dispatch last year, King predicted McCarthy would use the threat of similar reprisals to keep Greene in line.

“He’ll hang the sin that he committed against me out in front of her like the sword of Damocles,” King said.

Editor's note: This article has been updated with Bednar's comments."	-15.18
"A spokeswoman for Republican congressional candidate Lauren Boebert on Tuesday tried to definitively stomp out the embers of the QAnon conspiracy fire that’s been singing the Rifle restauranteur’s campaign for months, even as a new brush fire cropped up concerning the Greek citizenship of beloved Hollywood star Tom Hanks.

“[Boebert] has been on the record numerous times saying that she does not support QAnon or other conspiracy theories,” campaign spokeswoman Laura Carno said in a phone interview Tuesday morning. “The news organizations that keep talking about this are just trying to make something out of something that isn’t there.”

Kyle Clark of 9News on Tuesday ran a segment on Boebert’s latest QAnon bobble – a tweet questioning Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden fundraising with Hanks, a new dual citizen after his many visits to the European nation and his charitable work in the wake of devastating wildfires there like the ones that are currently raging across the Western Slope of Colorado – most of which is in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District Boebert hopes to represent.

Boebert defeated five-term incumbent Scott Tipton in the June 30 Republican primary and now faces former Eagle and Routt County state Rep. Diane Mitsch Bush in the Nov. 3 general election. The Mitsch Bush campaign did not respond to an email request for comment on the latest QAnon controversy involving Boebert.

According to a USA Today story last week, a QAnon conspiracy theory on social media “falsely claims Tom Hanks became a citizen of Greece because it classifies pedophilia as a disability…” QAnon is a collection of conspiracy theories propagated on social media by an anonymous individual known as “Q”, who asserts there’s a deep-state Democratic conspiracy involving satanism and pedophilia that is out to get Republican President Donald Trump.

The FBI has warned QAnon poses a domestic terrorism threat.

Boebert has been trying to back away from QAnon after saying in May, “I hope that this is real because it only means that America is getting stronger and better, and people are returning to conservative values.” But then on Monday she stepped in it again, tweeting, “[Democratic Presidential candidate] Joe Biden is doing a fundraiser with newly minted Greek citizen Tom Hanks tomorrow. I just… no comment.”

Asked about the Hanks tweet, Boebert spokeswoman Carno responded via text Wednesday: “Instead of talking to the American people, Joe Biden was fundraising with Tom Hanks. That’s what Lauren responded to.”

Earlier in the day, Carno more broadly addressed the QAnon issue by alleging other Republican candidates are unjustly being painted with the same conspiracy-theory brush.

“The same media outlets that are trying to stir this thing up are going after [Republican Utah congressional candidate and former NFL player] Burgess Owens, who was on a radio station that these people say is associated with this QAnon,” Carno said. “They never asked him one single question about it, and now they are also trying to paint him.”

According to the Deseret News in Salt Lake City last month, Owens, speaking on the “The Common Sense Show” that’s part of the Patriots’ Soapbox news network on YouTube and is known as a “QAnon program”, was not asked directly about the conspiracy theory but “recently tweeted ‘Colorado chose wisely’ to … Boebert, who has said she hopes QAnon ‘is real.’”

Owens, who is facing incumbent Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams in Utah’s 4th Congressional District, ended the program by telling the hosts, “Thank you for all you guys are doing because I’m just part of the team.” A campaign spokesman said Owens wasn’t aware of QAnon.

Boebert certainly is by now.

“[QAnon] is not a thing,” Carno said Tuesday. “[Boebert] has been on record numerous times saying that she doesn’t support it and that she doesn’t support conspiracy theories in general, and we’re done talking about it.”

Asked about statements and a YouTube video Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger made over the weekend urging Trump and both political parties to disavow QAnon in the wake of the primary victory of Republican QAnon adherent Marjorie Taylor Greene in Georgia, Carno compared it to the ultimate gotcha question.

“Should [the GOP] also disavow wife-beating? Do you know what I mean?” Carno asked. “This is my problem with this whole direction of ‘When did you stop beating your wife.’ Stop it. We’re not going there. We have actual substantive things to talk about. We have 52,000 square miles of district and lots of people who want to see [Boebert].”

Kinzinger, according to Politico, felt like Greene’s primary victory and likely election to Congress in a heavily conservative district made it necessary to take on QAnon, which Trump has refused to do.

“I think up to maybe about a week ago there wasn’t a reason to denounce it because it didn’t need the attention, but now that it’s made mainstream — we have a candidate that embraces it that won a primary,” Kinzinger said. “The president hasn’t fully denounced it or denounced it at all. Now it’s time for leaders to come out and denounce it.”

Carno says Boebert addressed a rally of 200 people in Cortez over the weekend and is an ordinary person, not a politician, who clearly connects with the people.

“We are attempting to put this stupid [QAnon] thing to bed, but it’s all some of [Boebert’s opponents] have because they are looking for how are they are going to say that she is so popular out there with ordinary people, how are they going to go against her, and they’re choosing stuff like this,” Carno said. “I think it’s dumb for them to choose that from just a strategy standpoint.”

Asked if Boebert regrets her sympathetic comments about QAnon in May, Carno said, “That’s clearly what opened the door,” and explained that Boebert didn’t know enough about the conspiracy at the time.

“She’d heard of it; she knew something about it – not everything about it,” Carno said. “She was going from being a mom of four boys and a business owner to getting up to speed as quickly as possible on all of the federal issues, so she had heard about it, knew something about it, did not know everything about it, and the thing that she thought she had heard was that you’ve got people who are trying to undermine the president.

“We’ve got the [U.S. Attorney General’s] office looking into that; that’s what she connected it to,” Carno said of investigations by William Barr into the origins of the Russia investigation. “So anything that the AG and [Inspector General’s] offices are looking into, those are the things that she knows.”

On Tuesday, a Republican-controlled Senate panel confirmed the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller detailing widespread contacts between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials but stopped short of alleging a conspiracy. Barr, a Trump loyalist who recently called the probe the “Russiagate scandal”, is expected to release his own findings before the Nov. 3 election.

"(CNN) As he fired up a crowd of Trump supporters gathered at Arizona's state capitol last month, Rep. Paul Gosar falsely assured them that the election results could still be overturned. ""Once we conquer the Hill,"" the six-term Republican declared to a wave of cheers, ""Donald Trump is returned to being the president.""

Two and a half weeks later, Gosar was repeating baseless claims about stolen ballots and rigged voting machines in a speech to Congress when he found himself interrupted by chaos on the House floor. Within minutes, lawmakers were being evacuated out of the chambers as rioters advanced through the heart of American democracy -- spurred by the same rhetoric Gosar and some of his fellow Republicans had espoused.

The first part of Gosar's prediction, at least, had come true: Capitol Hill had been conquered.

The insurrection last week that left five people dead, including a Capitol police officer, has spurred a new move to impeac h President Donald Trump and a wave of criticism for the most prominent senators who voted to block President-elect Joe Biden's victory. But Gosar and several other of his GOP colleagues in the House are also facing new scrutiny for their incendiary language in the hours, days and weeks before the siege.

One of the top organizers of the movement that aimed to overturn the election results has claimed he worked closely with Republican congressmen. Ali Alexander, a leader of the ""Stop the Steal"" group, said in several Periscope livestream videos last month that he planned the rally that preceded the riot in conjunction with Gosar and two other congressional Republicans, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Andy Biggs of Arizona, as CNN first reported last week.

""We're the four guys who came up with a January 6 event,"" Alexander said in one video in December. ""It was to build momentum and pressure and then on the day change hearts and minds of Congress peoples who weren't yet decided or saw everyone outside and said, 'I can't be on the other side of that mob.'""

Brooks, a staunch conservative and one of Trump's closest congressional allies, was one of the first speakers at the National Mall rally that preceded the riot, and his fiery language helped set the tone for what came next.

""Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass!"" the six-term Republican shouted to the assembled protesters. ""Our ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives... Are you willing to do the same?""

Hours later, when some of the same people Brooks had spoken to were smashing windows at the US Capitol, the lawmaker livetweeted as he and his colleagues were being evacuated from the House chambers.

""Tear gas dispersed in Capitol Rotunda,"" Brooks wrote in a tweet posted from his iPad. ""Congressmen ordered to grab gas masks under chairs in case have to leave in haste!""

Brooks was the first member of Congress to say publicly that he would object to the certification of the electoral votes for Biden. The day before the Jan. 6 rally, he tweeted that Trump had ""asked me personally to speak & tell the American people about the election system weaknesses that the Socialist Democrats exploited to steal this election.""

After the insurrection, while Brooks condemned rioters and called for them to be ""prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" he has also repeatedly suggested on social media and in interviews that at least some of the people who stormed the Capitol were members of the left-wing group Antifa -- a baseless claim that has been widely debunked.

Like Trump, who said Tuesday that his remarks at the rally, when he urged supporters to ""fight like hell,"" were ""totally appropriate,"" Brooks has denied responsibility for the riot, telling a radio show host the day after the attack that he ""absolutely"" had no regrets.

He later argued in a statement Tuesday that his remarks could not have been the cause of the violence. ""No one at the rally interpreted my remarks to be anything other than what they were: A pep talk after the derriere kicking conservatives suffered in the dismal 2020 elections,"" Brooks wrote.

Gosar has closely associated himself with the Stop the Steal movement for months. He tagged or replied to Alexander in more than two dozen tweets since Election Day, sharing false rumors about mysteriously appearing ballots and deleted vote counts, and spoke at the December 19 rally at the Arizona state capitol that Alexander organized. He penned an online open letter last month titled ""Are We Witnessing a Coup d'etat?""

""Biden should concede,"" Gosar tweeted on the morning of last week's congressional vote, sharing a photo of the pro-Trump protesters gathered in front of the Washington Monument. ""I want his concession on my desk tomorrow morning. Don't make me come over there.""

As the insurrection was still going on, Gosar shared divergent messages about the rioters. In one tweet with a photo of people scaling the walls of the Capitol, Gosar wrote ""let's not get carried away here,"" adding that ""if anyone on the ground reads this and is beyond the line come back."" But on the right-wing social media network Parler, which has since gone offline, Gosar posted the same image with a different caption : ""Americans are upset.""

Even Gosar's family members say his language has gone too far. Several of his siblings -- who recorded a viral campaign ad for one of his opponents in 2018 -- have argued he should resign or be removed.

""My brother swore an oath to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic,"" the congressman's younger brother Tim Gosar, a private investigator in Fort Collins, Colorado, told CNN this week. ""And he has blatantly broken that oath.""

Gosar's office did not respond to a request for comment.

At the Arizona Stop the Steal rally with Gosar, Alexander played a video that he said Biggs, the chair of the conservative Freedom Caucus, had sent for the crowd.

""Andy Biggs here,"" the Arizona congressman said in the recording. ""I wish I could be with you. I'm in the DC swamp fighting on behalf of Arizona's residents and freedom fighters all over the country."" The crowd responded with a chant of ""Biggs! Biggs! Biggs!"" The Arizona Republic first reported the video on Monday.

A Biggs spokesperson told CNN that the congressman recorded the video at the request of Gosar's staff, and had never worked with Alexander.

""Congressman Biggs is not aware of hearing of or meeting Mr. Alexander at any point -- let alone working with him to organize some part of a planned protest,"" the spokesperson said. ""He did not have any contact with protestors or rioters, nor did he ever encourage or foster the rally or protests.""

Biggs was one of several Republican members of Congress who refused to wear masks in a secure room where lawmakers were staying during the riot, according to a video posted by the congressional news site Punchbowl. Several Democratic members have said in recent days that they tested positive for Covid after being in the room.

Other congressional Republicans also painted their efforts to oppose Biden's victory in sweeping, historic terms. In the days before the riot, Freshman Reps. Laura Boebert of Colorado and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia both called the Wednesday electoral vote certification a ""1776 moment.""

And speaking at the same rally as Brooks and Trump, Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, another newly elected member, told the crowd that ""the Republicans are hiding and not fighting"" and ""they are trying to silence your voice.""

""I want you to chant with me so loud that the cowards in Washington DC that I serve with can hear you,"" he declared.

A Cawthorn spokesperson said the congressman condemned the violence during the riot and has criticized Trump for ""directing protestors toward the Capitol.""

Two Democrats have introduced a resolution to censure Brooks for his comments at the rally, and others have argued for expelling Gosar and other congressional Republicans who backed efforts to overturn the election. Democratic leaders have not made plans yet to vote on a censure resolution, but the subject has been discussed repeatedly during private conference calls, Democratic sources say.

""Mo Brooks and others like him should resign,"" Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on CNN Monday. ""They should have the decency to resign. They don't belong in this institution. They have demonstrated a contempt for democracy and for freedom.""

Denver Riggleman, a moderate Republican who lost his primary nomination last year to a more conservative challenger, said that he thought GOP leaders needed to have a ""come to Jesus"" moment and hold the congressmen who fanned the flames of insurrection accountable. But he said he doubted that the GOP base would punish members like Gosar or Brooks when they were back on the ballot.

""Those elected officials probably will get reelected, and that's that's the issue that we have right now,"" Riggleman said. ""I think that's what scares me the most."""	-15.18
"WASHINGTON — The Senate rejected Sen. Rand Paul’s attempt to toss out Donald Trump’s second impeachment as unconstitutional Tuesday, but the gambit showed that Republicans are still overwhelmingly standing behind Trump even after he left office and are likely to acquit him.

Paul forced a vote arguing that Trump’s second impeachment trial is unconstitutional because he is no longer in office. Every Democrat voted against Paul, but they were joined by only five of 50 Republican senators — Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, and Pat Toomey. The 55–45 vote means Trump’s impeachment trial will go ahead.

Though Paul’s attempt failed, he succeeded in showing that there are more than enough Republicans loyal to Trump to acquit him in the trial. Before the vote, Paul correctly predicted that north of 40 Republicans would object to the trial. He said this demonstrates that the push to impeach Trump is “dead on arrival.”

It requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors for inciting a mob to storm the Capitol, meaning just 34 votes are enough to acquit. Democrats had hoped to get enough Republican support to convict Trump and then prevent him from running for office again with a simple majority vote. Nine out of ten Republican senators are now on record as saying the trial is unconstitutional. In theory, some could change their votes after hearing the case against Trump, but that would mean voting to convict in a trial that they already tried to toss out as illegitimate.

The vote shows the massive hold Trump still has over the Republican establishment, even after leaving the White House. Trump has no reluctance to try to destroy his intra-party critics, regularly calling for his supporters to launch primary challenges against his Republican opponents and vote them out of office.

Just moments before the vote Mitch McConnell, the head Republican in the Senate, would not say whether he believes Trump committed impeachable offenses by denying the election results and urging his supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn them. He then voted in support of Paul’s point of order.

Paul’s pitch that Trump’s impeachment is unconstitutional rested largely on semantics. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say a former president cannot be impeached. Instead, Paul argued that because the Constitution refers to “the president”, Congress’s impeachment powers only refer to the sitting president. (Trump was impeached by the House while still in office).

“If the accused is no longer president, where is the constitutional power to impeach him? Private citizens don’t get impeached,” Paul said on the Senate floor.

Constitutional scholars have largely dismissed his interpretation and there is historical precedent working against him. In 1876, War Secretary William Belknap attempted to head off a House vote on whether to impeach him for corruption by handing in his resignation just moments before the vote. The House voted to impeach him anyway and the Senate took up the trial, despite him being out of office. He ended up being narrowly acquitted.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Paul’s interpretation defies both historical context and “basic common sense.” He said it would give presidents a “constitutional get out of jail free card” allowing them to commit crimes just before leaving office without suffering consequences.

When reporters asked Paul about his interpretation of the Constitution giving presidents a blank check at the end of their term, he said that reputational damage would keep them in check. “I think that people are always judged based on their actions and there is probably a penalty that is being paid,” said Paul.

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson went even further than Paul, urging senators to declare Trump’s impeachment unconstitutional whether or not that is true.

Johnson said he was personally conflicted about whether Congress has the power to impeach a former president, saying “there are good arguments on both sides.” He said senators should consider questions such as “will it heal, will it unify” when voting.

"President Donald Trump’s approval rating among Republican voters is back on the uptick after it dropped earlier this month following the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a group of Trump supporters, underscoring the political risk facing Senate Republicans who are set to decide the president’s fate in their chamber’s upcoming impeachment trial.

Morning Consult Political Intelligence tracking conducted Jan. 15-17 found 79 percent of Republican voters approve of the outgoing president, up 3 percentage points from 76 percent in polling conducted Jan. 10-12, before 10 House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the insurrection that resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer."	-15.18
"By the end of President Donald Trump’s crusade against American democracy—after a relentless deployment of propaganda, demagoguery, intimidation, and fearmongering aimed at persuading as many Americans as possible to repudiate their country’s foundational principles—a single word sufficed to nudge his most fanatical supporters into open insurrection. Thousands of them had assembled on the Mall, in Washington, D.C., on the morning of January 6th, to hear Trump address them from a stage outside the White House. From where I stood, at the foot of the Washington Monument, you had to strain to see his image on a jumbotron that had been set up on Constitution Avenue. His voice, however, projected clearly through powerful speakers as he rehashed the debunked allegations of massive fraud which he’d been propagating for months. Then he summarized the supposed crimes, simply, as “bullshit.”

“Bullshit! Bullshit!” the crowd chanted. It was a peculiar mixture of emotion that had become familiar at pro-Trump rallies since he lost the election: half mutinous rage, half gleeful excitement at being licensed to act on it. The profanity signalled a final jettisoning of whatever residual deference to political norms had survived the past four years. In front of me, a middle-aged man wearing a Trump flag as a cape told a young man standing beside him, “There’s gonna be a war.” His tone was resigned, as if he were at last embracing a truth that he had long resisted. “I’m ready to fight,” he said. The young man nodded. He had a thin mustache and hugged a life-size mannequin with duct tape over its eyes, “traitor” scrawled on its chest, and a noose around its neck.

“We want to be so nice,” Trump said. “We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. We’re going to have to fight much harder. And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us.”

About a mile and a half away, at the east end of the Mall, Vice-President Pence and both houses of Congress had convened to certify the Electoral College votes that had made Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the next President and Vice-President of the United States. In December, a hundred and forty Republican representatives—two-thirds of the caucus—had said that they would formally object to the certification of several swing states. Fourteen Republican senators, led by Josh Hawley, of Missouri, and Ted Cruz, of Texas, had joined the effort. The lawmakers lacked the authority to overturn the election, but Trump and his allies had concocted a fantastical alternative: Pence, as the presiding officer of the Senate, could single-handedly nullify votes from states that Biden had won. Pence, though, had advised Congress that the Constitution constrained him from taking such action.

“After this, we’re going to walk down, and I’ll be there with you,” Trump told the crowd. The people around me exchanged looks of astonishment and delight. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them—because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength.”

“No weakness!” a woman cried.

Before Trump had even finished his speech, approximately eight thousand people started moving up the Mall. “We’re storming the Capitol!” some yelled.

There was an eerie sense of inexorability, the throngs of Trump supporters advancing up the long lawn as if pulled by a current. Everyone seemed to understand what was about to happen. The past nine weeks had been steadily building toward this moment. On November 7th, mere hours after Biden’s win was projected, I attended a protest at the Pennsylvania state capitol, in Harrisburg. Hundreds of Trump supporters, including heavily armed militia members, vowed to revolt. When I asked a man with an assault rifle—a “combat-skills instructor” for a militia called the Pennsylvania Three Percent—how likely he considered the prospect of civil conflict, he told me, “It’s coming.” Since then, Trump and his allies had done everything they could to spread and intensify this bitter aggrievement. On December 5th, Trump acknowledged, “I’ve probably worked harder in the last three weeks than I ever have in my life.” (He was not talking about managing the pandemic, which since the election has claimed a hundred and fifty thousand American lives.) Militant pro-Trump outfits like the Proud Boys—a national organization dedicated to “reinstating a spirit of Western chauvinism” in America—had been openly gearing up for major violence. In early January, on Parler, an unfiltered social-media site favored by conservatives, Joe Biggs, a top Proud Boys leader, had written, “Every law makers who breaks their own stupid Fucking laws should be dragged out of office and hung.”

On the Mall, a makeshift wooden gallows, with stairs and a rope, had been constructed near a statue of Ulysses S. Grant. Some of the marchers nearby carried Confederate flags. Up ahead, the dull thud of stun grenades could be heard, accompanied by bright flashes. “They need help!” a man shouted. “It’s us versus the cops!” Someone let out a rebel yell. Scattered groups wavered, debating whether to join the confrontation. “We lost the Senate—we need to make a stand now,” a bookish-looking woman in a down coat and glasses appealed to the person next to her. The previous day, a runoff in Georgia had flipped two Republican Senate seats to the Democrats, giving them majority control.

Hundreds of Trump supporters had forced their way past barricades to the Capitol steps. In anticipation of Biden’s Inauguration, bleachers had been erected there, and the sides of the scaffolding were wrapped in ripstop tarpaulin. Officers in riot gear blocked an open flap in the fabric; the mob pressed against them, screaming insults.

“You are traitors to the country!” a man barked at the police through a megaphone plastered with stickers from “InfoWars,” the incendiary Web program hosted by the right-wing conspiracist Alex Jones. Behind the man stood Biggs, the Proud Boys leader. He wore a radio clipped onto the breast pocket of his plaid flannel shirt. Not far away, I spotted a “straight pride” flag.

There wasn’t nearly enough law enforcement to fend off the mob, which pelted the officers with cans and bottles. One man angrily invoked the pandemic lockdown: “Why can’t I work? Where’s my ‘pursuit of happiness’?” Many people were equipped with flak jackets, helmets, gas masks, and tactical apparel. Guns were prohibited for the protest, but a man in a cowboy hat, posing for a photograph, lifted his jacket to reveal a revolver tucked into his waistband. Other Trump supporters had Tasers, baseball bats, and truncheons. I saw one man holding a coiled noose.

“Hang Mike Pence!” people yelled.

Soon the mob swarmed past the officers, into the understructure of the bleachers, and scrambled through its metal braces, up the building’s granite steps. Toward the top was a temporary security wall with three doors, one of which was instantly breached. Dozens of police stood behind the wall, using shields, nightsticks, and pepper spray to stop people from crossing the threshold. Other officers took up positions on planks above, firing a steady barrage of nonlethal munitions into the solid mass of bodies. As rounds tinked off metal, and caustic chemicals filled the space as if it were a fumigation tent, some of the insurrectionists panicked: “We need to retreat and assault another point!” But most remained resolute. “Hold the line!” they exhorted. “Storm!” Martial bagpipes blared through portable speakers.

“Shoot the politicians!” somebody yelled.

“Fight for Trump!”

A jet of pepper spray incapacitated me for about twenty minutes. When I regained my vision, the mob was streaming freely through all three doors. I followed an overweight man in a Roman-era costume—sandals, cape, armguards, dagger—away from the bleachers and onto an open terrace on the Capitol’s main level. People clambered through a shattered window. Video later showed that a Proud Boy had smashed it with a riot shield. A dozen police stood in a hallway softly lit by ornate chandeliers, mutely watching the rioters—many of them wearing Trump gear or carrying Trump flags—flood into the building. Their cries resonated through colonnaded rooms: “Where’s the traitors?” “Bring them out!” “Get these fucking cocksucking Commies out!”

The attack on the Capitol was a predictable apotheosis of a months-long ferment. Throughout the pandemic, right-wing protesters had been gathering at statehouses, demanding entry. In April, an armed mob had filled the Michigan state capitol, chanting “Treason!” and “Let us in!” In December, conservatives had broken the glass doors of the Oregon state capitol, overrunning officers and spraying them with chemical agents. The occupation of restricted government sanctums was an affirmation of dominance so emotionally satisfying that it was an end in itself—proof to elected officials, to Biden voters, and also to the occupiers themselves that they were still in charge. After one of the Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol, he insisted through a megaphone, “We will not be denied.” There was an unmistakable subtext as the mob, almost entirely white, shouted, “Whose house? Our house!” One man carried a Confederate flag through the building. A Black member of the Capitol Police later told BuzzFeed News that, during the assault, he was called a racial slur fifteen times."	-15.18
"The toplines of a tranche of new polls released since the Capitol insurrection show general themes: that Americans do not support the takeover of their government seat, and that President Donald Trump’s approval rating is steadily dropping.

But the crosstabs reveal a much darker picture. Majorities of Republican voters do not hold Trump or GOP lawmakers responsible for the violence their election fraud lies helped incite, and in some cases are even inclined to be sympathetic to the rioters themselves.

Trump’s GOP Allies

A full 70 percent of Republican voters in a Quinnipiac Poll released January 11 said that the Republican lawmakers who tried to stop the formal certification of President-Elect Joe Biden’s win were protecting democracy. Only 23 percent said they were undermining it.

Democrats in the same poll overwhelmingly saw the Republican lawmakers as undermining democracy by 90 percent, with only 9 percent saying they were protecting it.

The Republican numbers are similar in an ABC/Washington Post poll released Friday: of the 78 percent who approve of GOP lawmakers’ attempts to help Trump overturn the election, 51 percent said they didn’t go far enough. A mere 16 percent of Republicans said their attempts went too far.

And again, in an Economist/YouGov poll: 67 percent of Republicans either somewhat or strongly support the objections to the Electoral College certification.

The data helps explain the galling lack of introspection and self-reflection on the Republican side, when it comes to reckoning with their behavior that led to the mob. Their constituents, as captured in the polling, don’t believe they did anything wrong by crying election fraud despite a lack of proof.

Instead, most GOP lawmakers have been preaching “unity,” encouraging the incoming administration to turn the page on the insurrection and start the process of “healing.”

Trump Himself

Republican absolution held steady when the question was applied to Trump in the Quinnipiac poll: 73 percent of Republicans said Trump is protecting democracy to 20 percent who said he’s undermining it. Democrats, by 95 percent, said he’s undermining democracy to 4 percent saying he’s protecting it.

Meanwhile, in the same poll, a whopping 80 percent of Republicans do not hold Trump accountable for the Capitol siege.

That result is born out in the later ABC/Washington Post poll, where 78 percent of Republicans said that Trump bears no responsibility for the riot, or only some.

The Economist/YouGov poll shows a similar result: 72 percent of Republicans do not think Trump incited his supporters to violence, while 11 percent do. For the Democrats, 81 percent think Trump did incite the mob.

This attitude may explain the Republican resistance to punishing Trump thus far. On Wednesday, only 10 House Republicans joined the Democratic caucus to impeach Trump. Those 10 are already facing repercussions; there is a full-fledged intra-party campaign to boot Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), the highest-ranking Republican to vote for impeachment, from her leadership role.

The numbers may also be indicative of how the Senate trial portion of impeachment will shake out, if it ever happens. Reports of Republicans like Senate Majority Mitch McConnell (R-KY) seriously considering voting to convict Trump may be framing up the vote to be closer than it will be. Based on this data, Republicans will be voting in direct contradiction to how the vast majority of their constituents feel if they vote to remove Trump from office, or at least keep him from holding it again, depending on when the trial happens.

Trump’s Mob

In this area, the Quinnipiac poll shows Democratic and Republican voters to be on largely the same page when it comes to the rioters who stormed the Capitol: majorities of both, 70 percent of Republicans and 95 percent of Democrats, said the rioters were undermining democracy. Even bigger majorities of both groups want them held accountable.

But the Economist/YouGov poll suggests that many of these same voters share the rioters’ underlying objection to certifying the election. Seventy one percent of Republicans somewhat or strongly approve of the Trump supporters protesting the Electoral College certification — approval only slips when the Trump supporters breached the Capitol building itself.

In the same poll, Republicans also displayed sympathy to the rioters, with a plurality, or 42 percent, saying that they were “mostly peaceful” to 35 percent saying they were “mostly violent.” A large majority of Democrats, 84 percent, said the rioters were mostly violent.

Another poll, CBS News/YouGov, adds a shade of nuance to how Republicans feel about the Capitol invasion. While 73 percent of them say it was not an attempt to overthrow the government, 56 percent say it was an attempt to overturn the election and keep Trump in power. It’s a sign of how effective Trump’s conspiracy theory peddling has been that a majority of Republicans, at least in this poll, see overturning the November election result as preserving, not overthrowing, the government.

They’re also much more generous about the rioters’ aims than Democrats are, with 43 percent of Republicans describing the mob’s actions as “patriotism” and 50 percent saying the rioters were “defending freedom.”

Now, over a week after the insurrection, Democrats are demanding accountability and Republicans are starting to reckon with what a thoroughly Trumpified party is without Trump at its head.

These polls lay bare the massive problems with both holding Republicans to account for their behavior and purging Trump from the party. Trump’s poisonous election conspiracy theories, amplified by Republican lawmakers, have effectively seeped into the worldview of their constituents captured by this polling. Even if they don’t like the invading of the Capitol itself, the majority of Republicans appear to agree with the rioters’ underlying fury stemming from a conviction that the November election was stolen, and that Trump’s administration is coming to an unfairly early end.

When one party has so fully absorbed the fictionalized account that Biden is an illegitimate president, true “unity” seems a long way off."	-15.18

"Four months later, on Easter Sunday, some assholes attacked multiple churches and hotels, killing 269 of us. My wife and kids were at church, I had to frantically call them back. Our nation was shattered. Mobs began attacking innocent Muslims. It was out of control. The coup broke our government, and four months later, that broke us.

The coup was a farce at the time but how soon it turned to tragedy. They called it a constitutional crisis, but how soon it became a real one. Right now, the same thing is happening to you. I’m trying to warn you America. It seems stupid now, but the consequences are not.

You’re being coup’d.

Neither of these people should be in the Speaker’s chair. USA, 2021. Sri Lanka in 2018

1 | You’re being couped

What is a coup? It’s literally a blow, a strike. Someone hitting your normal processes of government, trying to knock them over. The blow doesn’t have to succeed. It still wounds. In our case it was occupying Parliament without a majority. In yours it’s denying the President-Elect after an election. [Oh wait, now you’ve attacked your Congress as well]. Whether it fails or not, deep structural damage is done. At the time, however, it just feels dumb.

Frankly, I expected more epaulets and tanks, but this is all you get. A bunch of dumbasses throwing chili powder. Someone at Four Seasons Total Landscaping, next to a dildo shop. What a fucking stupid century. This is what our coups look like.

As a recovering coup victim to another, let me tell you this. The first step is simply accepting that you’ve been coup’d. This is hard and your media or Wikipedia may never figure this out (WTF does constitutional crisis mean? Is murder an existential crisis?), but it’s nonetheless true. The US system is weird, but people voted for a change of power. One person is refusing to accept the people’s will. He’s taking power that doesn’t belong to him. That’s a coup.

Americans are so caught up with the idea that this can’t be happening to them that they’re missing the very obvious fact that it is.

What else do you call Donald Trump refusing to leave, consolidating control of the military, and spreading lies across the media? That, my friends, is just a coup. You take the power, you take the guns, and you lie about it. American commentators say “we’re like the third world now” as if our very existence is a pejorative. Ha ha, you assholes, stop calling us that. You’re no better than us. The third world from the Sun is Earth. You live here too.

America, in fact, is worse than us. America’s democracy is a lightly modified enslavement system that black people only wrested universal franchise from in 1965. It’s frankly a terrible democracy, built on voter suppression of 94% of the population, full of racist booby traps and prone to absurd randomness. For example, your dumbass founders left enough time to get to Washington by horse. Four months where a loser could hold power, later reduced to two. This is a built-in coup.

Think about it. Your system gives the loser all the power and guns for two whole months. Almost every modern democracy changes power the next day, to avoid the very situation you’re in.

America constitutionally coups itself every election and it only doesn’t go bad by custom. America is a shitty and immature democracy, saved only by the fact that they didn’t elect equally shitty and immature Presidents. Until now.

Here’s how you would describe the same events happening to us:

Coups happen to white people too. As Ashton Kutcher would say:

It’s absurd, because the whole thing seems like a clown show. Coups are supposed to be orderly, authoritarian, not this dumb shit. It honestly seems like a grift to bilk supporters out of more money. You can just roll it back, right? Right?

No. No no no. Oh God no.

The tragic thing which you do not understand — which you cannot understand — is that you’ve already lost. You cannot know exactly what — that’s the nature of chaos — but know this. You will lose more than you can bear.

We lost our children, playing at church. We lost our friends, sitting down to brunch. Muslims lost their dignity and rights. Your Republicans have set forces into play they cannot possibly understand and certainly cannot control. And they don’t even want to. To them, chaos is a ladder.

This is the point. You have taken an orderly system balancing a whole lot of chaos and fucked with it. I don’t know how it’s going to explode, but I can promise you this. It’s going to explode.

This is precisely why we have elections, and why both sides accept the results. To keep the chaos at bay. The whole point is that you have a regular, ritual fight rather than fighting all the time. Once one side breaks ritual then you’re on the way to civil war. Once you break the rules then chaos ensues. What exactly happens? I don’t know. It’s chaos.

One side has stopped believing in elections. This is very bad. Via Mediaite

This is a major problem, and it won’t just go away on a technicality. I’m telling you, as someone that’s been there, you’ve already lost. It doesn’t matter if you get Trump out. He and the Republican Party are destroying trust in elections in general. This is catastrophic. You have no idea.

Your media are covering this like a high school dance, but it’s not funny. See this headline in the NYTimes. It’s wildly irresponsible. All your local coverage is.

No you fools, they’re supporting a coup

Ha ha ha, they lede, who’s going to tell him? Bitch, who’s going to tell you? An illegitimate leader has got all the guns and 40% of your population is down to use them. And y’all got jokes.

What I can tell you — what anyone who’s experienced this can tell you — is that it’s going to be bad. I didn’t know that churches and hotels would blow up on Easter Sunday, but I know now. I’m trying to tell you in advance. You’ve opened up a Pandora’s box of instability. All kinds of demons come out.

I have lived through a coup. It felt like what you’re feeling now. Like watching something stupid and just waiting for it to go away. But it doesn’t go away. You can forget about it, but it doesn’t go away.

There’s a ticking bomb at the heart of your democracy now. Your government, the very idea of governance is fatally wounded. Chaos has been planted at its heart. I don’t know what this chaos will grow into, but I can promise you this. It won’t be good.

Please understand.

My wife and children were at church that day. Our regular church (where they hadn’t gone) had bombs on either side. I couldn’t understand the news when I first got it and you cannot understand the fear until they were safely home. I do not want you to understand but I fear one day you must. You have fucked with chaos and soon chaos will fuck with you. To quote Yeats,

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

I’ll close with the one thing that kept my own family safe.

Good luck."	-15.18
"In 2011, I sat down for a lengthy interview with Justin Timberlake, who told me that he was having the time of his life as a big screen star. Even though he’d experienced a few setbacks (“I bombed all my auditions,” he confessed), he was in the middle of promoting two romantic comedies and he had another film out that fall. Most of our conversation focused on his revitalized movie career.

Timberlake, who first appeared on “The Mickey Mouse Club” with Britney Spears and Ryan Gosling, said he had been studying acting for a long stretch. His inspiration was Will Smith, who successfully transitioned from music to “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” to box office megastar. But then Timberlake said something that surprised me. “I have no aspirations of being a movie star,” he said. “I need no more attention.”

(Almost on cue, a young man came up to the patio where we sat and asked for a photo, which Timberlake briskly declined.)

I couldn’t tell if this was faux modesty or not, so I never published that part of our interview. But it seems weirdly appropriate now: Timberlake’s “Runner Runner” was a spectacular box office flop. The gambling drama only eked out $7.6 million in its opening weekend, despite the casting of Ben Affleck, post-“Argo,” as a slimy casino boss.

There are plenty of reasons for “Runner Runner’s” failure. The reviews were awful, and Timberlake (at 32!) is hardly plausible as a brainy Princeton graduate student trapped in an illegal Costa Rica gambling scheme. None of the film’s principals did much press for the movie released by 20th Century Fox, so they must not have had confidence in the finished product either.

At a Manhattan showing on Sunday night, the unfortunate group inside my theater had to wiggle past the excited crowds waiting for “Gravity.” Timberlake, who is meant to anchor “Runner Runner,” struggles with most of the screenplay’s cheesy dialogue. In other scenes, he comes across like a lost celebrity hosting “Saturday Night Live” who can’t find the teleprompter.

But the real problem with “Runner Runner” stems from what Timberlake told me. Even if he can peddle zillions of iTunes singles or concert tickets, most of his groupies aren’t going to follow him to the bigscreen. He will never be a movie star, and it’s a mystery why he took such a long hiatus from music to appear in so many movies. Now that he has a hit new album, “The 20/20 Experience,” it might be a good idea for Timberlake to give up acting.

He put his cinematic ambitions on the map with 2006’s “Alpha Dog” and 2008’s disastrous “Love Guru.” But it was his dazzling turn as Napster founder Sean Parker in the “The Social Network” that got him noticed. (He told me that he joked with his friends about getting business cards that read, “David Fincher Put Me in a Movie.”) After that, there was a flood of offers. Since 2010, he’s appeared in more pictures — eight — than real working actors Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts or Tom Cruise.

Timberlake was the voice of Boo Boo in “Yogi Bear,” a nerdy high school teacher (“Bad Teacher”), a GQ magazine editor who couldn’t keep his clothes on (“Friends with Benefits”), a sci-fi bandit (“In Time”), a baseball recruiter in a Clint Eastwood movie (“Trouble With the Curve”) and a folk singer in an upcoming Coen brothers’ musical dramedy (“Inside Llewyn Davis”). While some of these performances aren’t bad, they pale in comparison to what he’s accomplished as a musician. An artist who can rock the MTV Video Music Awards like Timberlake doesn’t need a second mediocre career.

In his heyday, Elvis Presley had 31 Hollywood acting credits and he became his own franchise at the movies. Throughout the ’80s and mid ’90s, Bette Midler, Cher and Madonna all had viable film performances (and an Oscar win). But something changed in Hollywood around the time that “Total Request Live” marked the final hurrah for musicvideos. It could be that the millennial generation found the idea of bigscreen divas unappealing or the bubble gum pop stars weren’t versatile enough to make the leap.

But whatever it was, many one-named superstars who tried to transition to the big screen flopped — from Britney (“Crossroads”) to Mariah (“Glitter”), Christina (“Burlesque”), Jessica (“Dukes of Hazzard”) and Kelly (“From Justin To Kelly”). Jennifer Lopez may be the exception, but she was introduced to Hollywood as a dramatic actress first in “Selena.”

On the other hand, the Internet revolted when Justin Bieber pretended to nab the part of Robin in the new Warner Bros. Batman installment.

In the new Hollywood model, the singers who successfully bridge into film do so in supporting or character roles. Jennifer Hudson won the Oscar for “Dreamgirls,” even though it was Beyonce’s name at the top of the credits.

After Mariah failed in “Glitter,” she redeemed herself in “Precious.” Lenny Kravitz is a great stylist for Katniss in “The Hunger Games.” Lady Gaga has cameos in Robert Rodriguez’s “Machete 2” and “Sin City 2.” Adam Levine makes his movie debut in “Can a Song Save Your Life?” with Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo. Taylor Swift, who had a small role in “Valentine’s Day,” was recently announced in “The Giver” with Streep and Jeff Bridges.

If there’s one lesson Timberlake can learn from all these other acts, it’s that he should stick to ensemble parts, because he can’t carry a film on his own. His best onscreen work has been wedged between other strong performances in both “The Social Network” and “Inside Llewyn Davis.” But after “Runner Runner,” I still think he should take a break from the movies. Please stop sending him scripts."	-15.18
"Justin Timberlake is getting the best acting reviews of his career, playing the founder of Napster, Sean Parker, in the new film The Social Network.

Parade’s Jeanne Wolf found out that, even with all of his success in music and on film, he knows there’s still a “geek” inside of him.

Social media is on everyone’s minds.

“I write music ‘on the side’ so it has obviously been a huge deal for the music industry and now the film industry, so I think, even without this movie, we would be talking about social media. It’s kind of serendipitous that a film like this could be made and is coming out around the time that it is. It’s the thing we are all talking about.”



Photo Timeline: Justin Timberlake’s Mane Milestones

Diving into the acting pool.

“I’ve always admired the art of acting, and it’s no secret that I was trained as a very young kid on a television show with other extremely talented actors and singers. On top of that, I’m also extremely aware of the perception of me as an artist. I think that’s why I made the choices that I made for myself. That’s why I chose the smaller films that I’ve done. I thought that I’d rather have the experience of the process from people who are really respected and admired, and characters that I can really dive into, rather than cash in, so to speak. I’m not really interested in that. Having an experience like this, working with actors that I admire and respect, and obviously one of my favorite directors of all time, it’s a very humbling experience. It’s been something that I’ve always dreamed of.”

Does he feel more secure about his musical talent?

“I think I’m equally insecure about all of it. I’ve been doing this for two-thirds of my life, but I still consider myself as very young. When you are making it, the process is the best part. Your senses are in creative high. Everybody has a little geek in them, you know? I love the process of making films and making music.”

Don’t expect a friend request from Justin.

“I don’t personally have a Facebook page, but I work with a group of people, do charity work through it, so it’s nice to engage as many ways as possible because when something happens, like in Haiti, you can see what good you can do in the world. Other than that, I don’t care about my friends’ feelings — they can just call me and tell me. I feel like a dinosaur because if I was on it, I wouldn’t know how to operate it.”

Social Network‘s Andrew Garfield: ‘I Have an Unusual Relationship With Facebook’

He’s not alone in his feelings about Facebook.

As we’ve been promoting the film, I get the idea collectively that none of us are really that savvy using Facebook or any other social-networking site. I’m ridiculously stupid when it comes to computers and social networking, but I think the [question] is still: Is it a good thing or is it a bad thing? The accessibility and the instant gratification of having all of your photos and profile and everything lined up, I think that’s what makes something like Facebook or any other social networking site so great to people. But I think the intrigue is that we still wonder if it’s going to create great things in the world, or if we’re going to waste away with it and that’s probably what is going to get people in the theater.”

Channeling Napster founder Sean Parker.

“I briefly bumped into him in New York one time, but we spoke for probably all of two minutes. And, ironically, I met him before I was cast in the role. He seemed to be very nice, but we didn’t really talk about much. He just mentioned that he had read the script and he thought that I was going to be playing the part. I think that when I read the first two scenes, I thought, ‘How can you not love this guy?’ His brashness, his sort of cynical wit, his brilliance just popped off the page.”

Praise for director David Finch.

“He is one of the most brave directors you could ever be lucky enough to work with. But, I’ll say this as well: he does not get bored easily. And when I say easily, I mean at all. Every take he would find something that was so specific. There was no question in your mind what he was trying to get you to accomplish, what he wanted to see through your character. I’ve never seen someone so hyper-smart and multitasking. To watch him direct the camera operator, Jesse [Eisenberg] and then myself, and then have the set designer come in and move the blinds an inch because he wanted to shield the light at an angle and I watched. There was a 25-minute session where the blinds were moving back and forth. And I was literally like, ‘What angle of light is he trying to accomplish?'”

Did his experience with music videos prepare him for acting in films?

“Back when we used to make those dinosaurs called music videos? I guess a video like ‘Cry me a River’ that I worked with on with Francis Lawrence and ‘What Goes Around’ with Sam Bayer that actually Nick Cassavettes was kind enough to write some dialogue for — those two are probably the most similar, because they are kind of a short-film style. I think that there is a lot of musicality to acting.”"	-15.18
"Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake have become parents for the second time, DailyMail.com can exclusively reveal.

The 38-year-old actress gave birth to a baby boy earlier this week and is currently holed up with the newborn, her singer husband Timberlake, 39, and eldest son Silas, five.

DailyMail.com understands Biel's mother Kimberly Conroe Biel, 65, has also spent much of the past week with her daughter and newest grandchild.

At Kimberley's Salida, Colorado, home on Saturday, a friend revealed she plans to stay with Biel and Timberlake until Sunday and confirmed the sex of the new baby.

Representatives for both Timberlake and Biel have been contacted for comment.

Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake have become parents for the second time, DailyMail.com can exclusively reveal. The couple is pictured with their son, Silas, in a social media snap taken last year

Timberlake and Biel have not been pictured publicly since March and are thought to have been staying at their home in Big Sky, Montana, since March 25.

An Instagram photo posted that day by Timberlake shows Biel from a distance standing in a snowy valley surrounded by mountains.

With the exception of that post, no photos showing Biel from the waist down have been released since her birthday in March, when she would have been around four months pregnant.

Those pictures, which appear to have been taken at the couple's Los Angeles home, show Biel in her pajamas and shrouded in a loose robe while blowing out candles on a cake held by Timberlake.

The actress has not shared any full-body photos to social media since her birthday party back in March

The couple - who have been dating since 2007 - are pictured out in New York with son Silas in February. Biel would have been around three months pregnant at the time

Instead, the pair have focused their social media output on highlighting causes close to their hearts such as Black Lives Matter and justice for Breonna Taylor, while limiting images of themselves to throwback shots taken over the past year.

On July 4, Biel posted a video on Instagram from 2019 showing herself and Timberlake learning how to throw axes at targets.

She also posted a throwback snap of eldest son Silas – on his fifth birthday on April 8 – showing him slung over her shoulder and exhorting followers to donate to Save the Children and Feeding America.

Biel's lookalike mother Kimberley has also featured in several of her posts, including one put online to mark International Women's Day on March 8.

The birth of the couple's new son comes just eight months after Timberlake was caught canoodling with his co-star Alisha Wainwright, 31, during a night out in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Timberlake and Wainwright were filming NFL movie Palmer at the time, in which they play lovers.

Photos from their night out in the Big Easy show Wainwright touching Timberlake's knee before he was snapped taking hold of her hand.

Onlookers told the Sun Timberlake, who was not wearing his wedding ring, appeared to have been drinking heavily but said he and Wainwright 'were smiling and laughing'.

Two weeks later, Timberlake apologized to Biel for the indiscretion with a public mea culpa posted on Instagram in which he admitted to drinking too much on the night in question.

In it, he said: 'I stay away from gossip as much as I can, but for my family, I feel it is important to address recent rumors that are hurting the people I love.

'A few weeks ago, I displayed a strong lapse in judgement – but let me be clear – nothing happened between me and my co-star.

The pair have been hiding out in Big Sky, Montana with son Silas and Biel's mom, Kimberly

Dropping hints? The couple were seen wearing 'Mama Bear' and 'Papa Bear' robes in a snap shared to Instagram by Timberlake on May 10

'I drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior. I should have known better. This is not the example I want to set for my son.

'I want to apologize to my amazing wife and family for putting them through such an embarrassing situation, and I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be.

'This was not that. I am incredibly proud to be working on Palmer. Looking forward to continuing to make the movie and excited for people to see it.'

Neither Biel nor Wainwright have ever publicly addressed the incident, with Biel instead continuing to focus on her acting work.

She does appear to have forgiven Timberlake, however, and has used her social media to declare her love for him and their older son Silas.

On Valentine's Day, she posted a photo of the pair, with the caption: 'My valentines [heart emoji]. Love you guys to the [moon emoji].'

On May 10, she posted another family snap which appears to have been taken in Montana, and which read: 'These two people make being a momma the greatest job in the whole world! The moments spent with you are truly the most precious and funniest and glorious times of my life.

'I love you both so much.'"	-15.18
"“Don’t be pissed off I’m an actor,” Justin Timberlake recently sang, explaining why he’s taken a sabbatical from music to concentrate on his burgeoning movie career: “I’m doing me.” And yet, some of Timberlake’s fans can’t understand the crossover: This is the biggest male pop star in the world, and he’s set it all aside (Timberlake hasn’t even begun work on a new album since 2006’s FutureSex/LoveSounds) to appear in films like Yogi Bear and next summer’s Friends With Benefits? The fans of his music are so ardent that they’re willing to hack his hard drive to dig up unreleased music — but does he have a fan base that’s just as eager to see him in a movie? To figure out what kind of future he’s got, we talked to industry experts and asked them the question, “If Justin Timberlake were a stock, would you buy, sell, or hold?”

Stock History: Timberlake has made four justifiably celebrated appearances on Saturday Night Live, and his versatility and enthusiasm came as a surprise to many, though it shouldn’t have: He honed his variety-show skills as a young member of The Mickey Mouse Club, which produced performers like Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. Still, casting directors took note, and Timberlake was cast as the lead in the 2005 drama Edison, along heavyweights like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. The virtually unknown film made barely a ripple.

Rebooting his approach and riding high off his second solo album, Timberlake went up for showy supporting roles in films like Alpha Dog and Black Snake Moan (and, in two famous misfires, The Love Guru and Southland Tales). Still, it wasn’t until he landed the third-billed role of Sean Parker in The Social Network that real acting accolades began to come his way, and Sony responded with a vote of confidence by placing him in the 2011 comedies Bad Teacher and Friends With Benefits. (He’s currently shooting Andrew Niccol’s sci-fi thriller Now, where he plays the lead opposite Amanda Seyfried.)

Peers: Garrett Hedlund (26), Sam Worthington (34), Tom Hardy (33), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (29), Ryan Reynolds (34), James McAvoy (31), Taylor Kitsch (29) and Ryan Gosling (30).

Market Value: Unclear. Timberlake’s biggest hit was his voice role in Shrek the Third, which took in almost $800 million worldwide, but you can credit him for that as much as you can credit Ned Beatty for Toy Story 3’s success. In live action, until he made The Social Network (which has grossed almost $100 million domestically, with Oscar nominations to come), few of the movies that Timberlake supported were notable performers, and many faded fast. And Social Network was sold largely on its real-life story, as well as director David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin.

What Hollywood Thinks: Publicists think that when it comes to audience goodwill, Timberlake has nailed his transition from singer to actor-glasses-wearing serious artiste. “His PR? Perfection,” said one. “There’s nothing wrong. Everybody loves him. He’s talented as a singer. He’s very down-to-earth, comes across as friendly, nice. SNL helps immeasurably: If you’re willing to make fun of yourself, you’re golden. And he is.”

But does being well-liked necessarily confer movie-star appeal? One rep raised a red flag: “He seems like a guy only women respond to, not a guy’s guy. He can do some comedy. I think the question mark is whether men will connect with him. I guess he’s made his commitment to his acting career, but time will tell. I have my doubts that guys will respond to him as a leading man.”

It’s a relevant concern: So far, Timberlake has done best in supporting roles, and all of his bids for leading-man glory have tanked. Last year, he starred opposite Jeff Bridges in an indie film called The Open Road, and despite the fact that it was released just months before Bridges won an Oscar for Crazy Heart, it made a brutal $19,716 in theaters. “He’s not exactly a young Clint Eastwood,” added the agent. “By that I mean when boys saw Tom Hardy in Inception, they were sold. The other problem near-term is that Friends With Benefits, from what I hear, it’s Mila Kunis’s movie, not his.”

The Analysis: It’s undeniable that Timberlake’s acting career is heating up; if you thought he was around a lot this year, just wait until 2011, when he’s got two summer comedies and a sci-fi thriller to open. Still, he remains a casting question mark for many in Hollywood. Timberlake was a finalist for the lead role in Green Lantern, but it went to Ryan Reynolds, who was coming off an unequivocal live-action hit in The Proposal. Even David Fincher has admitted that he was reluctant to cast Timberlake in The Social Network, fearing that his pop-star fame would prove too distracting.

Some think Fincher should have trusted that instinct. “He’s gotten a lot of attention for The Social Network, but to me, the simple fact was that he, being Justin Timberlake, completely took you out of the movie,” said an agent. “I mean, there are few pop stars in 2003 that were bigger than Justin Timberlake. It’s no fault of Timberlake; he just shouldn’t have been cast.”

Though the crossover from musician to movie star has been pulled off by plenty of performers like Will Smith and Queen Latifah, few were as famous for their music as Timberlake was at his peak, and few have had a path to stardom that comes with as much baggage (despite the fact that Timberlake has famously dated dream girls like Jessica Biel and Cameron Diaz, many men simply won’t warm to a male pop star with a famous boy-band past). As an actor, Timberlake is trying to woo a segment of an audience who used him as a punch line when he was in ‘N Sync, and though he overcame that during his transition to adult crooner, it’ll be harder for him to convince moviegoers that he’s a different person onscreen.

The Bottom Line: In January, Justin Timberlake will be 30. If he wants to be an A-list young actor, it’s now or never, so who can hurt him for trying? Indeed, his 2011 bid for leading-man status finds him starting off in a comedic wheelhouse that could work for him without alienating male audiences; instead of going the full McConaughey, he’s picked some edgy, R-rated romantic comedies that will help burnish the adult bona fides he may have sacrificed by voicing Boo-Boo in Yogi Bear.

But what comes next? Now is an intriguing thriller, cast with a terrific ensemble including Olivia Wilde and Vincent Kartheiser, and though audiences may not be ready for the idea of Timberlake as an action star, a sci-fi thriller gets the same thrust across in a less alienating way. An Oscar nomination for The Social Network would have helped, but it now looks unlikely; instead, Timberlake will have to keep himself content with accepting romantic-comedy roles and Chris Pine’s leftovers. Still, for someone whose other job is being a music megastar, is there anything wrong with steady work on the B-plus list?

"Wikipedia list article

The use of profanity in films has always been controversial, but has increased significantly in recent years.[1][2] The use of the word fuck in film draws particular criticism; in 2005, the documentary Fuck dealt entirely with this phenomenon.[3] The word fuck is thought to be the taboo term used most in American film.[4] The 1927 Motion Picture Production Code, better known as the ""Hays Code"", banned the use of profanity outright.[5] It wasn't until 1968 that the Motion Picture Association of America established a system of ratings to use as a guide to determine the appropriateness of a movie's content.[6] In 1970, M*A*S*H became the first American film to use the word fuck.[7]

The MPAA rating system assigns a PG-13 rating if a film contains the word.[8] The R rating is normally required if the film contains two utterances or if the word is used in a sexual context; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In some cases, filmmakers appealed the rating because their target audience might avoid an R-rated film. Censors have been more lenient about the word in films that portray historical events.[8] The ratings system is voluntary, there is no legal requirement that filmmakers submit their movies to be rated.[6]

This is a list of non-pornographic, English language films containing at least 150 spoken uses of the word fuck (or one of its derivatives), ordered by the number of such uses.

"Justin Timberlake drew criticism when he signed up to star in Woody Allen's latest film, Wonder Wheel.

Many have asked Timberlake to speak out against Allen, who was accused of molesting his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, when she was seven. But it seems that Timberlake isn't interested in getting involved in any form of controversy. ""I chose to not get into it — I really don't dive into any of that stuff with anybody,"" Timberlake said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.

As for being cast to star in a Woody Allen film, which is still a coveted spot by many, Timberlake says that he never thought it could happen to him.

""I can't really say that doing a Woody Allen movie was ever on my bucket list,"" said Timberlake. ""Because I never even thought that doing a Woody Allen movie might be a possibility.""

This interview comes days after Rose McGowan, one of the dozens of whistle-blowers against Harvey Weinstein, called Timberlake a hypocrite for wearing a Time's Up pin to support women and men who've been sexually abused after he worked with Allen.

""Then there’s Justin Timberlake hashtagging ‘My wife looks hot tonight hashtag Time’s Up’ hashtag I just did a movie with Woody Allen,'"" she said in an interview on The View. ""So come on, it is fake. I wish it weren’t — I wish everybody were good. I’m sorry to puncture your heroes, but sometimes these heroes need to be better.""

But JT doesn't seem to be losing any steam. Ahead of his Super Bowl performance this Sunday, JT dropped his fifth solo album, Man of the Woods. He also spoke to THR about his early days with N'SYNC and being BFFs with Jimmy Fallon. Read the entire piece here."	-15.18
"After HBO broadcast Leaving Neverland, its two-part documentary on two men who say Michael Jackson sexually molested them when they were children, actor Corey Feldman initially appeared to defend his late friend. But in an interview with HLN on Wednesday, he clarified that's not his intent. ""I don't want to be perceived as I'm here to defend Michael Jackson, because I can no longer do that,"" Feldman said. ""I cannot in good consciousness defend anyone who's being accused of such horrendous crimes.""

The two men featured in the documentary, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, are ""very believable,"" Feldman said, based on his own experience as a victim of child sex abuse, and their accusations are ""shocking and disturbing. There's nothing else that can be said for it."" But he said he also wasn't there to ""judge"" Jackson, because ""he didn't do those things to me and that was not my experience."" Feldman said his thoughts on Leaving Neverland changed as he processed the documentary, though he acknowledged he only watched the first half. ""To be honest with you, it was very emotional, it was very painful, and I couldn't watch all of it,"" he told HLN.

Feldman later tweeted that talking to HLN ""was the hardest interview I [have] ever done outside of the day [longtime friend Corey Haim] passed."" Feldman is making a documentary about his own experience as a survivor of child sexual abuse — he says he was abused starting at age 14 — and he is advocating for a removal of child sex abuse statutes of limitations in all 50 states.

Michael Jackson's estate is suing HBO for $100 million over Leaving Neverland, and Feldman said he wished the documentary ""happened while Michael was alive"" so Jackson could offer his side, preferably in a court of law. Peter Weber"	-15.18
"On an evening in mid-January, two friends caught up over Zoom: the actor and director Fisher Stevens, from the set of “Succession,” and the actor and musician Justin Timberlake, from a remote location, in a room that resembled a sauna. Both were bearded, affable, and wearing black sweaters. Stevens directed the new movie “Palmer,” out this week, in which Timberlake stars. “Hey, buddy!” Stevens called out. “Thank you for being flexible.” Timberlake smiled. “It’s all good,” he said. On “Succession,” Stevens’s character, Hugo, is a frequent punching bag for Logan (Brian Cox), the show’s patriarch; that day, the roughing up had run long. “Brian Cox yelled at me all day today,” Stevens said, beaming. “Not me—onscreen.” Timberlake, for his part, had just been announced as a performer at the Biden-Harris inaugural party. “It’s a crazy time for Justin and me both,” Stevens said. “But ‘Palmer,’ man! We loved making the film and loved working together, and we haven’t been able to kind of hang.”

Justin Timberlake Illustration by João Fazenda

Stevens, an Oscar-winning documentary director, was excited to direct a drama, and was surprised when Timberlake was suggested as a star: “I’m, like, That’s interesting.” He’d been impressed by him in films; then he saw him in concert. “I was blown away by the magnetism of him. Like, fuck! Wow. We talked about the script for a while and worked on ideas. It was a long dance with Justin to get him to do it.” (“I was incredibly difficult,” Timberlake said.) Stevens was on the set of “Succession,” Season 2, when he heard the good news about Timberlake. “I’ll never forget it,” Stevens said. “We were in Dundee, Scotland. I’m in between setups of this big scene with Brian’s character getting honored—that Jeremy Strong rap.” (Baseball shirt, “L. to the O.G.,” horror.) “And I get this call from Justin’s manager. I wanted to jump onstage and take the mike from Jeremy. ‘Yo! I’m gonna do a movie with Justin!’ ”

“Succession” skewers toxic masculinity via entertainingly baroque yelling; “Palmer,” a warm, patient film with sensitive performances, achieves similar ends through opposite means. Timberlake plays Eddie Palmer, an ex-convict and a former high-school football star who gets out of prison, moves in with his grandmother in rural Louisiana, struggles to find his way, and becomes a father figure to Sam (Ryder Allen), the son of a wayward neighbor. Sam’s love of playing with dolls, and of dressing up as princesses, is only part of his charm.

Timberlake, throughout his career, has tended to bring an air of comfortable ease to his performances, however unusual: singing and dancing at the Super Bowl or in a foam-rubber omelette suit and gloves on “S.N.L.”; playing Sean Parker, freewheeling Machiavellian, in “The Social Network.” In “Palmer,” his “first real ‘this is your movie’ experience,” as he put it, he conveys similar naturalness. “In my first conversations with Fisher, I remember saying, I know this guy,” Timberlake said. He also knew Sam. Timberlake, an only child, grew up in Memphis. “At eight years old, I was singing in church, and then found my love of the arts. I wanted to take voice lessons and was begging for piano lessons, starting to perform in local talent shows, and was bullied about it,” he said. “There’s something underlying here, which is our parameters of an idea of masculinity and what it means, especially in the rural South. I feel like I have a tiny bit of authority to speak on that, having experienced it. My grandfather, the loveliest man, would give you the shirt off of his back. But he was like John Wayne: barrel-chested, one of the toughest guys you had ever seen—you know, ‘Rub some dirt on it.’ There’s no time for men to have feelings.”

In the movie, Sam is bullied by a few but accepted by most: the townspeople aren’t ogres. Timberlake said, “In real life, there are delusional people, and then there are people like this”—moms cheerfully arranging tea-party playdates that include boys—“who do exist in the rural South.” He hopes that “Palmer,” in which “you watch these two misfits complete each other’s meaning,” has a positive impact during a volatile time. “Maybe you’re a parent and you see this movie and it has some sort of butterfly effect, where you influence your child to not stand by and watch bullying in the schoolyard,” he said. “This is where it begins.” Stevens took his sweater off, revealing a T-shirt that said “It’s a Warnock Life.” Timberlake went on, “I’m having a milestone month—I’m performing at maybe the most important Inauguration I can be a part of in my lifetime, and a song that’s a hopeful take on this moment. And then this movie, and then I turn forty.”

Timberlake and Ant Clemons premièred their song “Better Days” at a virtual concert for Fair Fight, of Georgia; on the Inauguration Day broadcast, they performed the song with students and alumni from the Stax Music Academy, in Memphis. “If you’re feeling lost in the night / It’s O.K. to cry, just as long as you hold your head,” they sang. “Better days are coming.” ♦"	-15.18
"Justin Timberlake keeps finding box-office success with roles in animated flicks like ""Yogi Bear."" And with so much buzz around his film ""The Social Network,"" in which he plays Napster founder Sean Parker, you might think that Timberlake has left the world of music behind for Hollywood. But JT knows that you want him to put out more music.

""They're looking at me like, 'Why aren't you staying with one path?' ""

he told the Los Angeles Times, referring to his fans' response to his shift in careers. ""They look at me like I'm ungrateful for my music career because I want to do film.""

Timberlake explains that he always wanted to act, even before selling millions and millions of albums with 'NSYNC, and he admits that his fans were just as riled up when he left the boy band to embark on his hugely successful and now revered solo career.

""I faced the same feelings when I went solo,"" he explained. ""I had the same obstacles in music. I still do. But I feel like I should pose the question to everyone else: If you had this opportunity, what would you do with it? Entertaining is in my blood. I make no bones about the fact that I have always wanted to work in the forum of film. I take this seriously. I'll be 30 in January, and I'm saying to myself, 'If I'm going to do this, I need to do it now.' ""

What it boils down to for Timberlake is that he doesn't just want to be famous at whatever he does — he wants to do it and see what happens regardless of the fan response. ""I don't know what a pop 'career' is. I just wanted to be in music,"" Timberlake said. ""I don't necessarily crave to be a movie star. I just want to be an actor. I don't look at it as a career — I just feel lucky. That's not to say I'm going to take every opportunity that comes up. But now I have more chance to plot out a path.""

Timberlake says that when the time is right and he can make it work for him again, he'll go back to recording music. ""I want to conceptualize something a little bit more,"" he said. ""And it's probably because of the experience I'm having working with directors and screenwriters and getting to play cool characters. If that means I come up with, like, my version of 'Ziggy Stardust,' so be it. Who knows? What I've learned from acting in movies, I want to apply to music and see what happens."""	-15.18
"Outside politics, outside the law, outside the norms—the seditionists have in fact declared their independence from the rest of us. January 6 was indeed their 1776: They declared that they want to live in a different America from the one the rest of us inhabit, ruled over by a different president chosen according to a different rule book. And yet they cannot be wished away, or sent away, or somehow locked up. They will not leave of their own accord, and Americans who accept Biden’s lawful victory won’t either. We have no choice except to coexist.

But how? Clearly we need regulation of social media, but that’s years away. Of course we need better education, but that doesn’t help us deal with the armed men who were standing outside the Ohio statehouse this week.

Joan Donovan: MAGA is an extreme aberration

Here’s another idea: Drop the argument and change the subject. That’s the counterintuitive advice you will hear from people who have studied Northern Ireland before the 1998 peace deal, or Liberia, or South Africa, or Timor-Leste—countries where political opponents have seen each other as not just wrong, but evil; countries where people are genuinely frightened when the other side takes power; countries where not all arguments can be solved and not all differences can be bridged. In the years before and after the peace settlement in Northern Ireland, for example, many “peacebuilding” projects did not try to make Catholics and Protestants hold civilized debates about politics, or talk about politics at all. Instead, they built community centers, put up Christmas lights, and organized job training for young people.

This was not accidental. The literature in the fields of peacebuilding and conflict prevention overflows with words such as local and community-based and economic regeneration. It’s built on the idea that people should do something constructive—something that benefits everybody, lessens inequality, and makes people work alongside people they hate. That doesn’t mean they will then get to like one another, just that they are less likely to kill one another on the following day.

Translating this basic principle to the vast landscape of the U.S. is not easy: We don’t have UN peacebuilding funds to pay for red-blue community centers, and anyway, American political opponents are often physically separate from each other. We are not fighting over control of street corners in West Belfast. But the Biden administration, or indeed a state government, could act on this principle and, for example, reinvigorate AmeriCorps, the national-service program, offering proper salaries to young people willing to serve as cleaners or aides at overburdened hospitals, food banks, and addiction clinics; sending them deliberately to states with different politics from their own. This might not build eternal friendships, but seditionists and progressives who worked together at a vaccination center could conceivably be less likely to use pepper spray on each other at a demonstration afterward."	-15.18
"the New Washington Most G.O.P. Senators Vote Against Holding Impeachment Trial for Trump In a 55-to-45 vote that strongly suggested that the Senate would not be able to convict the former president, lawmakers narrowly killed a Republican effort to dismiss the impeachment charge as unconstitutional. President Biden signed executive orders intended to promote racial equity. This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the Biden presidency.

Most Republicans vote against trying Trump, signaling he is likely to be acquitted of the impeachment charge. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 2:31 - 0:00 transcript Despite G.O.P. Efforts, Senators Become Jurors in Impeachment Trial Senators were sworn in as jurors in the impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump, after the Senate voted, 55-45, to proceed despite a Republican effort to dismiss the charge as unconstitutional. “Will all senators now rise and raise their right hand. Do you solemnly swear that all things appertaining to the trial, the impeachment of Donald John Trump, former president of the United States, now pending, you do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?” “All persons are commanded to keep silence on pain of imprisonment while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States an article of impeachment against Donald John Trump, former president of the United States.” “Mr President. The senator from Kentucky.” “Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution says the president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Article 1, Section 3, Clause 6 states, when the president of the United States is tried the chief justice shall preside. As of noon last Wednesday, Donald Trump holds none of the positions listed in the Constitution. He is a private citizen. The presiding officer is not the chief justice, nor does he claim to be. His presence and the chief justice’s absence, chief justice’s absence demonstrate that this is not a trial of the president, but of a private citizen. Therefore, I make a point of order that this proceeding, which would try a private citizen and not a president, a vice president or civil officer, violates the Constitution and is not in order.” “By constitutional text, precedent and common, basic sense, it is clearly and certainly constitutional to hold a trial for a former official. Former President Trump committed, in the view of many, including myself, the gravest offense ever committed by a president of the United States.” “The Senate, sitting as a court of impeachment, is adjourned until Tuesday, February [9], at 1 p.m. Senators were sworn in as jurors in the impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump, after the Senate voted, 55-45, to proceed despite a Republican effort to dismiss the charge as unconstitutional. Credit Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A majority of Republicans rallied on Tuesday against trying former President Donald J. Trump for “incitement of insurrection,” with only five members of his party joining Democrats in voting to go forward with the impeachment trial for his role stirring up a mob that attacked the Capitol. The 55 to 45 vote cleared the way for Mr. Trump’s second impeachment trial, by narrowly killing a Republican effort to dismiss the charge as unconstitutional. But it strongly suggested that the Senate did not have the votes to convict the former president. The opposition of all but a handful of Republicans underscored Mr. Trump’s continued strength in the party even after his brazen campaign to overturn his election defeat, fueled by false claims of voting fraud, and the deadly assault by his followers after he urged them to go to Congress to fight the result. Senators could yet change their views. But for now, the vote signaled the likelihood that Mr. Trump would for the second time in a year be acquitted by the Senate in an impeachment trial, spared by loyal Republicans who were reluctant to break with him. It would take two thirds of senators — 67 votes — to attain a conviction, meaning 17 Republicans would have to cross party lines to side with Democrats in finding him guilty. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, is said to believe Mr. Trump committed impeachable offenses surrounding the deadly Capitol siege, had asserted that the former president “provoked” the mob, and had said he was undecided on the charge. Yet he voted with the vast majority of the party to uphold the constitutional challenge, which would have effectively terminated the trial if it had prevailed. His entire leadership team joined him. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, forced the vote after arguing that it was unconstitutional to hold an impeachment trial of a former president, an assertion widely disputed by scholars and even the Senate itself in the past. “Private citizens don’t get impeached. Impeachment is for removal from office, and the accused here has already left office,” Mr. Paul said, calling the trial “deranged” and vindictive. He declared victory afterward, saying: “Forty-five votes means the impeachment trial is dead on arrival.” The only Republicans who joined Democrats in voting to put aside his objection and proceed were Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania. All five had previously said they were open to hearing the impeachment case. “My review of it has led me to conclude it is constitutional in recognizing impeachment is not solely about removing a president, it is also a matter of political consequence,” said Ms. Murkowski, who has praised the House’s bipartisan impeachment and called Mr. Trump’s actions “unlawful.” Democrats bluntly rejected Republicans’ argument that the proceeding was unconstitutional. “The theory that the impeachment of a former official is unconstitutional is flat-out wrong by every frame of analysis,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, before moving to quash Mr. Paul’s attempt. The Senate has taken that position in the past. In 1876, as the House was preparing to impeach him on corruption charges, William Belknap, Ulysses S. Grant’s secretary of war, hurried to the White House, where he tendered his resignation in tears just before Congress could act. The House proceeded anyway, and when the case arrived in the Senate, a majority of the body decided that it retained jurisdiction to hear the case, notwithstanding Belknap’s departure from office. (The Senate ultimately acquitted him, however.) The action on Tuesday unfolded just after the Senate convened as a court of impeachment and senators took an oath, dating to the 18th century, to administer “impartial justice.” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the president pro tempore, was sworn in to preside over the proceeding and the Senate formally summoned Mr. Trump to answer the House’s charge. Senators then put the trial on pause for two weeks, agreeing to delay any further debate until Feb. 9. The pause will allow President Biden time to win confirmation of members of his administration and give Mr. Trump’s still-forming legal team a chance to prepare his defense.

In the first blow to Biden’s immigration agenda, a federal judge blocks a 100-day pause on deportations. Migrants at the border bridge in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, last week. Credit... Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters In the first legal challenge to the Biden administration’s immigration agenda, a federal judge in Texas has temporarily blocked a 100-day pause on deportations. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas on Tuesday issued a 14-day nationwide temporary restraining order sought by the state’s attorney general that would prevent carrying out the policy, which was issued by the Homeland Security Department within hours of President Biden’s inauguration. The order will remain in effect until the judge has considered a broader motion for a preliminary injunction. The judge, Drew B. Tipton, who was appointed by former President Donald J. Trump, said in his ruling that the suspension of deportations would violate a provision of the immigration statute as well as another law that required agencies to provide a rational explanation for their policy decisions. The immigration law states that people with final orders of removal from the United States must be deported within 90 days. The court held that the 100-day pause violated that requirement and that the mandatory language of the immigration law should not be “neutered by the federal government’s broad discretion.” The court also held that the agency’s memorandum violated a separate law that required agencies to provide a logical and rational reason for their policy changes. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Department had run afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act because it failed to supply adequate justification for the temporary suspension of deportations. Immediately after taking office, Mr. Biden began dismantling some of his predecessor’s initiatives that were intended to curb both legal and illegal immigration to the United States. The president has issued a series of executive orders, including one to repeal a travel ban that targeted majority-Muslim countries. Immigration advocates challenged many of Mr. Trump’s policies in federal court, and the decision by Judge Tipton on Tuesday signaled that immigration hawks might also sue to stymie Mr. Biden’s initiatives. “The court’s order shows the uphill battle President Biden has in trying to reverse the prior administration’s immigration restrictions,” said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration lawyer and a professor at Cornell Law School. “A single judge can halt a federal agency’s effort to review and reprioritize its immigration enforcement policies.” After the decision on Tuesday, Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas said on Twitter that it was a victory against the left. “Texas is the FIRST state in the nation to bring a lawsuit against the Biden Admin. AND WE WON,” wrote Mr. Paxton, a Republican, who is under federal investigation for bribery and abuse of power accusations raised by former aides. “Within 6 days of Biden’s inauguration, Texas has HALTED his illegal deportation freeze,” Mr. Paxton wrote. “This was a seditious left-wing insurrection. And my team and I stopped it.” In a letter last week to David Pekoske, the acting secretary of homeland security, Mr. Paxton called the plan a “complete abdication of the Department of Homeland Security’s obligation to enforce federal immigration law” that would “seriously and irreparably harm the State of Texas and its citizens.” Thousands of immigrants in detention centers have deportation orders that can be executed once they exhaust their legal appeals. Thousands more who live in the interior of the country could be arrested because they have outstanding deportation orders. The Biden administration said that the pause was intended to allow time for an internal review. The moratorium would cover most immigrants who faced deportation, unless they had arrived in the United States after Nov. 1, 2020, were suspected of committing acts of terrorism or espionage, or posed a threat to national security. “We’re confident that as the case proceeds, it will be clear that this measure was wholly appropriate in ordering a temporary pause to allow the agency to carefully review its policies, procedures and enforcement priorities — while allowing for a greater focus on threats to public safety and national security,” a White House spokesman said on Tuesday. “President Biden remains committed to taking immediate action to reform our immigration system to ensure it’s upholding American values while keeping our communities safe.”

Biden moves to end Justice Dept. contracts with private prisons as part of focus on targeting racial inequality. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:11 - 0:00 transcript Biden Lays Out Plans to Advance Racial Equity President Biden on Tuesday signed executive actions to address prison reform, affordable housing and police reform to uphold one of his central campaign pledges: advancing the cause of racial equity. I believe this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equality — equity. Yes, we need criminal justice reform, but that isn’t nearly enough. We need to open the promise of America to every American. And that means we need to make the issue of racial equity not just an issue for any one department of government. It has to be the business of the whole of government. And the simple truth is our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist. We can’t eliminate everything overnight. We can’t eliminate everything. But it’s corrosive. It’s destructive, and it’s costly. We must change, and I know it’s going to take time, but I know we can do it. And I firmly believe the nation is ready to change, but government has to change as well. We need to make equity and justice part of what we do every day. I’m going to sign these executive actions to continue the work, to make real the promise of America for every American. President Biden on Tuesday signed executive actions to address prison reform, affordable housing and police reform to uphold one of his central campaign pledges: advancing the cause of racial equity. Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden signed executive orders on Tuesday to end Justice Department contracts with private prisons and increase the government’s enforcement of a law meant to combat discrimination in the housing market, part of the new administration’s continued focus on racial equity. Mr. Biden also signed orders that make it the federal government’s policy to “condemn and denounce” discrimination against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, who have faced harassment since the coronavirus pandemic spread from China to the United States and to strengthen relationships between the government and Native American tribes. The moves are incremental pieces of Mr. Biden’s broader push for racial equity — an initiative that is expected to be a centerpiece of his administration and that follow an executive order last week directing federal agencies to review policies to root out systemic racism. The government effort is led by Susan E. Rice, who runs the Domestic Policy Council. “I’m not promising we can end it tomorrow, but I promise you, we’re going to continue to make progress to eliminate systemic racism,” Mr. Biden said before signing the orders. He added that “every branch of the White House and the federal government is going to be part of that effort.” The orders are an escalating repudiation of President Donald J. Trump’s policies and attitudes toward race relations. In separate executive orders last week, Mr. Biden overturned a Trump administration ban on diversity training in federal agencies and disbanded a Trump-created historical commission that issued a report aiming to put a more positive spin on the nation’s founders, who were slaveholders. In a conference call with reporters, a senior White House official described the Trump administration’s “heinous” Muslim ban and said certain minority groups were treated with a “profound level of disrespect from political leaders and the White House.” Jim Tankersley and

Biden said his administration was nearing a deal with Pfizer and Moderna for 200 million more doses by summer’s end. It may not speed up vaccinations. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:08 - 0:00 transcript Biden Administration Orders 200 Million More Vaccine Doses President Biden announced on Tuesday that his administration was working on a deal to secure the doses of coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer and Moderna by the end of the summer. The deal is unlikely to accelerate the current pace of vaccination for several months. This will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we’ve ever undertaken as a nation. I’ve said that before, but I must say it again, because we’re going to do everything we can to get it done. After a review of the current vaccine supply and manufacturing plans, I can announce that we will increase overall weekly vaccination distributions to states, tribes and territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses. And we believe that we’ll soon be able to confirm the purchase of an additional 100 million doses for each of the two F.D.A.-authorized vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna. That’s 100 million more doses of Pfizer and 100 million more doses of Moderna — 200 million more doses than the federal government had previously secured. Not in hand yet, but ordered. We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer. We didn’t get into this mess overnight. And it’s going to take months for us to turn things around. But let me be equally clear: We’re going to get through this. We will defeat this pandemic. President Biden announced on Tuesday that his administration was working on a deal to secure the doses of coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer and Moderna by the end of the summer. The deal is unlikely to accelerate the current pace of vaccination for several months. Credit Credit... Jim Wilson/The New York Times President Biden announced on Tuesday that his administration was nearing a deal with Pfizer and Moderna to secure an additional 200 million doses of coronavirus vaccine by the end of the summer — a time frame that his predecessor had also envisioned, and one that may not accelerate the current pace of vaccination for months. The purchases would boost the administration’s total vaccine order by 50 percent, raising it from 400 million to 600 million doses — enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans by the “end of the summer, beginning of the fall,” Mr. Biden said. Although the president has been in office for less than a week, he is already under intense pressure from a frustrated public to accelerate vaccinations. Tuesday’s announcement will enable Mr. Biden to underscore that he shares those concerns. The deal would provide the federal government with 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 100 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, Mr. Biden said. Speeding up what has been a slow distribution of vaccines has taken on more urgency with the arrival of more contagious virus variants in the country. But while the president has vowed to use the Defense Production Act if necessary to increase vaccine supply, there is little he can do in the short term. Federal health officials and corporate executives agree that it will be hard to boost the immediate supply of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines — the only two that have federal authorization — before April because of lack of manufacturing capacity. Pfizer had agreed last summer to provide an initial 100 million doses to the United States by the end of March. Under a new agreement reached last month by the administration of former President Donald J. Trump, Pfizer agreed to provide an additional 70 million doses by the end of June and another 30 million by the end of July, doubling the deliveries it promised in the initial contract. This latest deal would apparently obligate Pfizer to deliver another 100 million over the summer, or roughly the third quarter of the year. The original contract said that while the government could request that new tranche of vaccine, Pfizer could “reasonably” refuse it. But there was little expectation that Pfizer, an American company, would do so. Mr. Biden also said the federal government’s weekly allocations of coronavirus vaccines would increase by about 1.4 million doses starting next week. “This is going to allow millions more Americans to get vaccinated sooner than previously anticipated,” he said. The increase, to around 10 million doses given to states, territories and tribes each week, will come from the federal government’s plans to release more of the vaccine made by Moderna, the Massachusetts biotech company whose vaccine was authorized for emergency use in December. Although governors will probably welcome the news, it does not reflect any increase in the overall amount that Moderna will deliver to the federal government in the first three months of this year, according to people familiar with the company’s production. Governor Andrew Cuomo, the chairman of the National Governors Association, said that New York, where more than 42,000 people have died, welcomed both the increase in doses and Mr. Biden’s assurances that those vaccine allocations would be maintained in weeks to come. “You really can’t plan and schedule when you don’t know what you’re going to get next week,” Mr. Cuomo said on MSNBC. At the same time, he conceded “it’s not enough,” as the state continues to try to vaccinate nearly 20 million residents. “At this rate, we’re talking about months and months,” he said.

Capitol Police chief apologizes for security failures during the assault, including a delay in calling for Guard troops. The acting Capitol Police chief, Yogananda D. Pittman, told a House panel that the agency “failed to meet its own high standards as well as yours.” Credit... J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press The acting chief of the Capitol Police apologized to Congress on Tuesday for the agency’s extensive security failures on Jan. 6, acknowledging during a closed-door briefing that the department knew there was a “strong potential for violence” but failed to take adequate steps to prevent what she described as a “terrorist attack.” Yogananda D. Pittman, the acting chief of police, also confirmed that the Capitol Police Board, an obscure panel made up of three voting members, had initially declined a request two days earlier for National Guard troops and then delayed for more than an hour as the violence unfolded on Jan. 6 before finally agreeing to a plea from the Capitol Police for National Guard troops, according to prepared testimony obtained by The New York Times. In an extraordinary admission, Chief Pittman, who was not the acting chief at the time of the siege, told members of the House Appropriations Committee, which oversees funding for the agency, that the Capitol Police “failed to meet its own high standards as well as yours.” She added, “I am here to offer my sincerest apologies on behalf of the department.” Chief Pittman’s predecessor, Steven Sund, resigned after the riot. Chief Pittman’s comments offered the fullest detailed account to date about police preparations for Jan. 6, when thousands of angry protesters, believing false claims that the election had been stolen, marched on the Capitol at the behest of former President Donald J. Trump. Speaking by video conference in a virtual briefing, Chief Pittman told the committee that the department “should have been more prepared for this attack,” according to the remarks. Chief Pittman said that her department knew Jan. 6 would be unlike previous protests. She said her department knew that militia groups and white supremacists organizations would descend on Washington. “We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event,” she said. “We knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target. The department prepared in order to meet these challenges, but we did not do enough.” She said the Capitol Police had 1,200 people working on site when the attack occurred, which was “no match” for “the tens of thousands of insurrectionists.” Two days before the attack, Chief Sund requested that the Capitol Police Board declare a state of emergency and authorize a request to secure National Guard support. The board denied the request, according to Chief Pittman, but encouraged Chief Sund to contact the National Guard to determine how many guardsmen could be sent to the Capitol on short notice, which he did. As the protesters became an increasing threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6, Chief Sund asked for more help from federal agencies and law enforcement agencies in the area. “He also lobbied the board for authorization to bring in the National Guard, but he was not granted authorization for over an hour,” Chief Pittman said. During the hearing, the commander of the District of Columbia National Guard told committee members that his authority to quickly deploy the guard was removed ahead of the riot. Maj. Gen. William J. Walker, the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, said he had such authority for July 4, but the Pentagon required additional approval for a request for the guard during the Capitol attack, according to a person familiar with the testimony. General Walker testified that Chief Sund called him as the threat to the Capitol increased on Jan. 6 and that he immediately notified the Army. “On my own, I started preparing people to be ready, but I had to wait for specific approval to go out to launch,” General Walker said. “I was in constant communication with the U.S. Army leadership who was acting on behalf of the Secretary of the Army.” Two of the board members at the time of the attack have already resigned: Paul D. Irving, the House sergeant-at-arms, and Michael C. Stenger, the Senate sergeant-at-arms. The third member, J. Brett Blanton, the Architect of the Capitol, is still on the board. Mr. Blanton was nominated by Mr. Trump in December 2019 and confirmed by the Senate that same month. The chief of the Capitol Police serves in an ex-officio, non-voting capacity. “In my experience, I do not believe there was any preparations that would have allowed for an open campus in which lawful protesters could exercise their First Amendment right to free speech and at the same time prevented the attack on Capitol grounds that day,” Chief Pittman said. In the aftermath of the attack, many officers are suffering from PTSD, she said, “particularly after the loss of two of our officers directly and indirectly as a result of the events of January 6th.” Officers also have been experiencing an increase in coronavirus infections. During the briefing, the acting House sergeant-at-arms, Timothy P. Blodgett, also said it was “clear there was a failure of preparation,” citing poor communications and a weak perimeter defense of the Capitol. “Whether it was insufficient or conflicting intelligence, lacking ability to translate that intelligence into action, insufficient preparation or an inadequate ability to mobilize partner agencies for immediate assistance, a series of events, once thought unfathomable, unfolded allowing our most sacred halls to be breached,” Mr. Blodgett said.

Oliver Contreras for The New York Times Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the longest-serving senator and the president pro tempore, was briefly taken to a hospital in Washington for observation early Tuesday evening after he reported not feeling well, his spokesman said. He returned home a few hours later after an evaluation. Mr. Leahy, whose position in the Senate puts him third in line for the presidency, oversaw the start of the impeachment proceedings against former President Donald J. Trump earlier on Tuesday. At 80, Mr. Leahy is one of the oldest senators and has served in the Senate since 1975. After he reported not feeling well in his office, Mr. Leahy “was examined in the Capitol by the attending physician,” said David Carle, the spokesman. “Out of an abundance of caution, the attending physician recommended that he be taken to a local hospital for observation, where he is now, and where he is being evaluated.” Mr. Leahy was taken to George Washington University Hospital, where he received tests and “a thorough examination” before being released, Mr. Carle said. The senator “looks forward to getting back to work,” Mr. Carle said. Mr. Leahy has received both vaccine shots for the coronavirus, and it was unclear what his symptoms were. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and Mr. Leahy’s predecessor as president pro tempore, was among those who wished Mr. Leahy well in a tweet Tuesday evening.

Biden is moving to restore U.S. relations with Palestinians. President Biden’s new policy shift will include a resumption of American aid to the Palestinians. Credit... Mohammed Saber/EPA, via Shutterstock The Biden administration will restore diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority, more than two years after President Donald J. Trump effectively ended them. The action signals a return to a more traditional and evenhanded approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, after a Trump administration policy that was heavily slanted toward Israel. Richard Mills, the acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, announced the shift in a speech on Tuesday. The move will include a resumption of American aid to the Palestinians. Mr. Mills also reaffirmed support for a “mutually agreed, two-state solution” between Israel and the Palestinians, “in which Israel lives in peace and security, alongside a viable Palestinian state.” And he called on the parties to refrain from unilateral actions, such as the annexation of territory and settlement activity by Israel, or incitements to violence by the Palestinians, that could make such an outcome more difficult. Analysts and regional leaders say the prospects of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement are dimmer than they have been in decades. The parties have all but ceased communications, Palestinian leaders summarily rejected a peace plan offered by the Trump White House last year and the issue is not among Mr. Biden’s top foreign policy priorities. But the announcement is part of a broader return to previous U.S. foreign policy practices under Mr. Biden, and an end to the open hostility between Washington and the Palestinians fomented by the Trump administration. Guided by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump took an openly punitive approach toward the Palestinians with the goal of forcing them to make concessions to Israel, to little avail. The Biden administration’s policy shift was quickly cheered by Palestinian leaders and supporters of a negotiated solution between Israel and the Palestinians. “This is exactly the type of swift action the administration needs to take to restore American credibility as a diplomatic mediator between Israelis and Palestinians,” said Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a liberal advocacy group that supports an Israeli settlement with the Palestinians. Mr. Mills said the Biden administration would “take steps to reopen diplomatic missions that were closed by the last U.S. administration,” without offering specifics. In addition to closing the Palestinian Mission in Washington in September 2018, the Trump administration also closed the United States Consulate in East Jerusalem.

Antony J. Blinken is confirmed as secretary of state. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:00 - 0:00 transcript Blinken Is Confirmed by Senate as Secretary of State On Tuesday, the Senate voted to confirm Antony J. Blinken as the nation’s 71st secretary of state. “Mr. Blinken is just the right person to rebuild and reassert America’s national security prerogatives on the global stage, and reestablish the first instrument of American power: diplomacy. For four years, the failed diplomacy of the Trump administration weakened our alliances, strengthened and emboldened our adversaries and tarnished America’s reputation abroad. We must reaffirm our commitment to NATO and other critical alliances around the world.” “In my judgment, the JCPOA was a colossal failure and a real blunder for American policy overseas. In talking with Mr. Blinken, he does not share that view, and obviously is going to work with the president carrying the president’s water to get us back into the JCPOA. I think that’s a mistake.” “The yeas are 78, the nays are 22. The nomination is confirmed.” On Tuesday, the Senate voted to confirm Antony J. Blinken as the nation’s 71st secretary of state. Credit Credit... Pool photo by Alex Edelman The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Antony J. Blinken as the nation’s 71st secretary of state, installing President Biden’s longtime adviser who has a mission to rejoin alliances that were fractured after four years of an “America First” foreign policy. Mr. Blinken, 58, has already signaled he is prepared to roll back a number of State Department policies that were set under President Donald J. Trump. A centrist with an interventionist streak, he was approved by a vote of 78 to 22 after receiving mostly gentle prodding at his nomination hearing last week by senators who seemed eager to move past Mr. Trump’s confrontational approach to diplomacy. However, Mr. Blinken also told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last Tuesday that Mr. Trump “was right” to take a tougher tone against China, an overarching strategy that is certain to remain. “I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas but the basic principle was the right one,” Mr. Blinken said. “And I think that’s actually helpful to our foreign policy.” Yet Mr. Blinken described a measured willingness to rejoin other world powers in an agreement, which the Trump administration had jettisoned, to limit Iran’s nuclear program. He promised a harder line on Russian cyber hacks and election meddling — even as the Biden administration said it would work to extend an arms treaty with Moscow — and said he would review American policy toward North Korea, which he described as “a problem that has not gotten better. In fact, it’s gotten worse.” All are departures from the foreign policies under Mr. Trump. Mr. Blinken inherits a State Department where many diplomats say they are demoralized within an agency made up of about 1,000 fewer employees than when he left as its deputy secretary in early 2017. He told senators last week that he will view his plans to ensure diversity and multiculturalism in the diplomatic corps “as a significant measure of whether I succeeded or failed, however long I’m in the job.” That is another difference between his approach and that of his immediate predecessor, Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state who derided multiculturalism as “not who America is” just hours before Mr. Blinken’s defense of it. In contrast to Mr. Pompeo’s fiery rhetoric and swaggering diplomacy, Mr. Blinken is a mild-mannered strategist who grew up in New York and Paris as the son and nephew of American ambassadors and the stepson of a Holocaust survivor. Mr. Blinken, who plays in a rock band, is also a new father. He and his wife, a former senior State Department official, have two very young children at home, and he will be the first secretary of state in modern times to be raising toddlers while serving in office.

Janet Yellen, the first woman to be Treasury secretary, is sworn in by the first woman to be vice president. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Janet L. Yellen was sworn in as the secretary of the Treasury Department on Tuesday by Vice President Kamala Harris, a history-making moment as both are the first women to hold two of the most powerful jobs in the United States government. Ms. Yellen is the nation’s 78th Treasury secretary and the first woman to head the institution in its 232-year history. She is also the first woman to have held all three top economic jobs in the government, having served as chair of the Federal Reserve and the Council of Economic Advisers. She is taking the job at a time of economic crisis, with millions still out of work and the recovery slowing as the coronavirus persists. Ms. Yellen will quickly be thrust into fraught negotiations over how to design and pass a robust stimulus package to help revive an economy that has been hammered by the pandemic. Standing outside the White House, Ms. Yellen took the oath of office with her husband, the economist George Akerlof, and her son by her side. At the conclusion of the ceremony, Ms. Harris said, “Congratulations, Madam Secretary,” to which Ms. Yellen replied, “Thank you, Madam Vice President.” Ms. Yellen said on Twitter that she was proud to be joining the Treasury Department and described the field of economics, and the agency’s mission, as one that can “right past wrongs and improve people’s lives.” Economics isn’t just something you find in a textbook. It can be a potent tool to right past wrongs and improve people’s lives. That’s why so many of Treasury’s 84,000 public servants joined the Department.



Today, I am proud to be one of them. https://t.co/B4Y5Mpzt9s — Janet Yellen (@JanetYellen) January 26, 2021 Later in the day, Ms. Yellen sent a message to the Treasury Department’s staff, introducing herself, laying out her objectives and making clear that she plans to create a welcoming environment for career employees. Many career staff complained that Ms. Yellen’s predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, operated within a tight-knit inner circle and did not make use of their abilities. “These are ambitious goals, and I am fully aware none of them will be accomplished by working exclusively with a small team out of the secretary’s office,” Ms. Yellen said. “Ours will have to be an inclusive department.” The new Treasury secretary said in the memo that she plans to soon embark on a “listening tour” of the department, holding virtual meetings with each office and bureau to learn about what can be improved at the agency. The Treasury Department said that Ms. Yellen also spent her first day talking to her advisers and being briefed on the status of President Biden’s rescue plan and the implementation of the existing relief programs. The White House and lawmakers in Congress have begun the process of negotiating over President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion relief bill. Ms. Yellen, a labor economist, will assume a central role in making the case for why the economy needs more fiscal support. At her confirmation hearing last week, Ms. Yellen told senators that it was time to “act big” and that doing so would be fiscally responsible in the long run by creating a healthier economy. In a sign of the task ahead, the Treasury Department has been rapidly adding staff and advisers in recent days. Ms. Yellen was confirmed by a bipartisan vote on Monday, but her top deputy, Wally Adeyemo, and other senior officials who will oversee the department’s international affairs, sanctions and domestic finance divisions are not yet in place and will require Senate confirmation.

Gina M. Raimondo, Biden’s nominee for commerce secretary, testifies before the Senate. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:01 - 0:00 transcript Biden’s Commerce Secretary Nominee Testifies Before Senate Gov. Gina M. Raimondo of Rhode Island, President Biden’s nominee for commerce secretary, testified to the Senate on Tuesday about her plans to help the economy. “This confirmation hearing is just the starting point for our conversation about vital policy matters, including responding to the economic damage caused by the pandemic, investing in our people and small businesses, ensuring that American workers and manufacturers can compete fairly in the global market.” “The secretary of commerce will play an important role in strengthening our economy, and trying to defeat the pandemic and recover from its economic impacts. I think this is a critical job of the commerce secretary as we continue to see the impacts of Covid on our economy.” “Commerce Department has a simple, but vital mission: to spur good-paying jobs, empower entrepreneurs to innovate and grow, and help American workers and businesses compete. These are the same priorities that have guided my own life in my own career. In this time of overlapping crisis, the Commerce Department must be a partner to businesses and workers to help them innovate and grow.” Gov. Gina M. Raimondo of Rhode Island, President Biden’s nominee for commerce secretary, testified to the Senate on Tuesday about her plans to help the economy. Credit Credit... Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Gov. Gina M. Raimondo, President Biden’s nominee to be the next commerce secretary, told lawmakers on Tuesday that she plans to help American communities bounce back from coronavirus, aggressively enforce trade rules to combat unfair practices from China and leverage the power of the government to mitigate climate change if confirmed to a cabinet post. Ms. Raimondo, the governor of Rhode Island and a former venture capitalist, reassured members of the Senate Commerce Committee that she planned to work with them on priorities like protecting American fisheries, expanding broadband access that has become particularly vital for students during the pandemic, and promoting American research into cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced communications. The Trump administration made heavy use of the department’s authorities to crack down on Chinese technology firms, turning often to the so-called entity list, which allows the United States to block companies from selling American products and technology to certain foreign firms without first obtaining a license. Dozens of companies have been added to the Commerce Department’s list, including telecom giants like Huawei and ZTE, which many American lawmakers see as threats to national security. Ms. Raimondo declined to commit to keeping Huawei or other Chinese companies on the entity list when pressed to do so by Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas. But she vowed to use the powers of the Commerce Department “to protect Americans and our network from Chinese interference,” adding, “that’s Huawei, ZTE, or any other company.” “China’s actions have been anti-competitive, hurtful to American workers and businesses, coercive, and as you point out, they are culpable for atrocious human rights abuses,” she said. “Whether it’s the entity list, or tariffs, or countervailing duties, I intend to use all those tools to the fullest extent possible to level the playing field for the American workers.” Asked about the steel and aluminum tariffs levied on foreign countries by the Department of Commerce during the Trump administration, Governor Raimondo declined to say whether they would be removed or changed. She said that the Biden administration would carry out a broad review of trade policies in consultation with its allies, aggressively pursue uncompetitive trade behaviors from China and ensure that the process that excludes certain companies from the tariffs is swift, fair and objective. Several senators praised her combination of public and private sector experience, saying those skills could help the country deal with economic damage from the pandemic, invest in American workers and business, and promote the marine and space economies, which the Commerce Department oversees. Governor Raimondo, said that her background in the private sector as a venture capitalist and her experience as state treasurer and governor of Rhode Island have prepared her to help realize the Commerce Department’s mission to create good-paying jobs and empower American entrepreneurs and workers. “In this time of overlapping crises, the Commerce Department must be a partner to businesses and workers to help them innovate and grow,” Ms. Raimondo said.

Lloyd Austin, the new defense secretary, prepares to address sexual assault in the military. Lloyd J. Austin III, the new secretary of defense, ordered a review of how the Pentagon has been handling sexual assault cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times After years of failure to curb the scourge of sexual assault in the military, Lloyd J. Austin III, the new secretary of defense, is open to considering significant revisions to how those crimes are prosecuted, a potential sea change that generations of commanders have resisted. Overhauling the way the military handles sexual assault cases — by taking them outside the chain of command and assigning them to prosecutors with no connection to the accused — would need approval by Congress, where some legislators have long pushed for such a system. President Biden has been a vocal proponent of these changes, even as general after general has gone to Capitol Hill to argue against them over the past decade. “I had a real run-in with one of the members of the Joint Chiefs in the cabinet room on the issue,” Mr. Biden said last year at a fund-raiser. Mr. Austin’s first act as secretary was to order a review of how the Pentagon has been handling sexual assault cases. He is also being pushed by Congress. Senators repeatedly asked him how he planned to handle the problems of sexual harassment and assault in the military during his confirmation hearing this month. If Mr. Austin, a retired four-star army general, were to embrace these changes, he would be the first secretary to do so, a major shift in position for the Pentagon. “Every defense secretary since Dick Cheney has come up here and said nice things and then the fight behind the scenes was to protect the status quo,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, who has spent years pushing legislation on the issue.

Capitol riot investigation will slow as officials work to build more complicated cases, Justice Dept. says. Capitol Police officers stood outside a doorway that was damaged during the riot this month. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Justice Department officials said on Tuesday that the fast-moving federal investigation into the assault on the Capitol is expected to slow as investigators turn their attention to more complex matters such as conspiracy and sedition cases, the investigation into the death of Officer Brian D. Sicknick of the Capitol Police and violent attacks on members of the press. In the 20 days since rioters stormed the Capitol, the F.B.I. has received over 200,000 digital media tips and identified more than 400 suspects. Federal prosecutors quickly charged 150 criminal cases, many of which have now been elevated to felonies. But the manhunt and investigation is expected to “reach a period of a plateau,” said Michael R. Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington, as investigators shift from identifying and rounding up individuals to putting together more complicated conspiracy cases related to possible coordination among militia groups and individuals from different states who had planned to travel to the Capitol and engage in criminal conduct before the attack. “We have to have the proper evidence to charge these, and we’re going to get it,” said Steven M. D’Antuono, the F.B.I. assistant deputy in charge of the Washington field office. “All these cases are not based upon social media and Twitter and Instagram posts. We also have traditional law enforcement tools we need to use — grand jury subpoenas search warrants — and you don’t get that overnight.” Investigators said that some of those efforts could result in more complicated and serious cases being charged as soon as this weekend and through the coming weeks. In addition to conspiracy and sedition cases, Mr. Sherwin said he had assigned prosecutors to look specifically at attacks on members of the news media. Photographs, videos and eyewitness accounts detailed attacks on journalists, including photographers, reporters and camera operators. In one instance, rioters were seen on video attacking journalists stationed near the Capitol building. After forcing them to flee, the assailants took and destroyed their equipment. Rioters also attacked a photojournalist after discovering that she worked for The New York Times, throwing her to the ground, stealing one camera and breaking another. Inside the Capitol, reporters huddled with members of Congress and their staff before being taken to secure locations.

The Capitol attack wasn’t a ‘false flag.’ G.O.P. officials continue to spread the theory anyway. Rioters breaching the Capitol building on Jan. 6. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times In the hours after supporters of President Donald J. Trump engaged in a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol, some Republicans began advancing a fantastical alternative theory: that the attack was actually led by far-left activists trying to frame Republicans. The outlandish claims have been widely discredited by the authorities, and some of the faces in the Capitol crowd were recognizable right-wing figures. The numerous arrests since the assault have overwhelmingly involved devoted Trump supporters and far-right adherents. But despite the clear evidence, the so-called false flag theory continues to persist in Republican circles. Last week, the Oregon Republican Party passed a resolution falsely claiming that there was “growing evidence that the violence at the Capitol was a ‘false flag’ operation designed to discredit President Trump, his supporters and all conservative Republicans.” Bill Currier, the chairman of the Oregon Republican Party, said in a video discussion that state party officials were working with counterparts across the country to “coordinate our messaging” around the Capitol attack, the response to it and the continuing efforts to impeach the president. Mr. Currier said other states would be adopting similar resolutions. “There will be many states doing this,” Mr. Currier said. “We’re not the only ones.” In Wyoming, the state Republican Party issued a statement claiming without evidence that leftist groups may be poised to “engage in preplanned violent acts so that the Republican Party can be blamed.” The deflection comes as Republican officials have increasingly embraced conspiracy theories, often stoked by Mr. Trump or his allies. Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, has advanced conspiracy ideas about the Capitol attack, saying the riot was “preplanned” in “an attempt to slander Trump.”

Fox gives a show to one former Trump aide, but shoots down claims it hired another. Larry Kudlow, who led former President Donald J. Trump’s National Economic Council, had previously been a host on CNBC. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times Larry Kudlow, the former CNBC star who served as director of President Donald J. Trump’s National Economic Council, is returning to broadcasting. Mr. Kudlow was named the host of a new daily show on Fox Business set to begin later this year, the network said on Tuesday. He will also appear on Fox Business and Fox News as an on-air financial analyst starting Feb. 8. This is the first major television gig secured by a senior Trump aide who stayed in the White House until the president’s term ended last week. It is also something of a hiring coup for Fox Business, which competes against CNBC and will now feature one of its rival’s longtime featured players. Fox said that it would provide more information about Mr. Kudlow’s new weekday program at a later date. Mr. Kudlow’s hiring is the latest example of the revolving door between Fox News and members of the Trump administration. But another prominent Trump defender may not be headed to the Rupert Murdoch-owned network so soon. Kayleigh McEnany, the former White House press secretary, included an “employment agreement” with Fox News on a federally mandated disclosure form she filed earlier this month, signaling that she had landed a job at the cable channel. Fox News on Tuesday had a different message for Ms. McEnany: not so fast. “Kayleigh McEnany is not currently an employee or contributor at Fox News,” the network said in a statement. Ms. McEnany and Fox News did speak after Election Day about a potential on-air role, according to a person briefed on the negotiations who requested anonymity to share the details of private discussions. But the network has paused those talks, even as it remains open to hiring Ms. McEnany at a later date, the person said. Ms. McEnany did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Image Kayleigh McEnany, who worked at Fox News after college, suggested on a financial disclosure form that she had been rehired there. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times As the most prominent on-air defender of Mr. Trump in the tumultuous weeks after his loss in November, Ms. McEnany was a frequent guest on Fox News programs, particularly Sean Hannity’s prime-time show. Before joining the White House, Ms. McEnany served as an on-air commentator for CNN. She started her media career at Fox News after college, working for Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and the father of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, another former press secretary to Mr. Trump. Ms. Sanders joined the network as an on-air contributor shortly after she departed the Trump administration in 2019, but she and the network recently cut ties after she announced her candidacy for governor of Arkansas.

The White House press briefings will include an American Sign Language interpreter. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the Biden administration was taking the step as part of its commitment to inclusivity. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times The Biden administration announced this week that it would include an American Sign Language interpreter in its daily press briefings, a step that the previous administration avoided taking until a court ordered it to do so late last year. The move is a “historical first,” according to Howard A. Rosenblum, the chief executive officer of the National Association of the Deaf. Past administrations have occasionally had A.S.L. briefers at some White House events and meetings, Mr. Rosenblum said, but President Biden is the first to make it a fixture. “The president is committed to building an America that is more inclusive, more just and more accessible for every American, including Americans with disabilities and their families,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said during Monday’s briefing. She introduced the interpreter as Heather. Last year, Mr. Rosenblum’s advocacy group and five deaf Americans sued the Trump administration for holding briefings on the coronavirus without a sign language interpreter present, arguing that it was a violation of the First Amendment. The government responded that it had provided closed-captioning, but the plaintiffs said that was not an adequate substitute. A federal judge in Washington sided with the plaintiffs, and the Trump administration started including an interpreter in November. During his first few hours in office, Mr. Biden signed an executive order directing senior officials to look at ways to make sure people with disabilities and other minorities were not denied opportunities or government benefits. Mr. Biden also directed top leaders to break down federal data, including economic indicators, “by race, ethnicity, gender, disability, income, veteran status or other key demographic variables” to measure progress on equity goals. The move was praised by many economists."	-15.18

Manchin, speaking to reporters in the Capitol, reiterated that he does not support going ""nuclear"" to gut the 60-vote legislative filibuster and indicated that there was no timeline where, if Republicans blocked legislation, he would change his mind.

“I do not support doing away with the filibuster under any condition. It's not who I am,"" Manchin said.

His comments are the latest indication that Democrats do not have the votes to nix the 60-vote legislative filibuster, despite intense pressure from progressive groups, outside activists and a growing number of Democratic senators who support the idea.

Supporters of doing away with the 60-vote legislative hurdle warn that keeping it intact blocks legislation on a wide swath of issues including climate change, democracy reform and voting rights. With the filibuster in place, Democrats will be forced to use reconciliation, a budget tool that allows tax and spending bills to pass by a simple majority, which is limited.

To go ""nuclear"" — change the rules by a simple majority — Democrats would need every vote in their 50-vote caucus, and several have signaled that they are leery of changing the rules.

Sinema is ""against eliminating the filibuster, and she is not open to changing her mind about eliminating the filibuster,"" a spokesperson told the Post.

"Some rank-and-file Democrats, however, are taking the matter into their own hands and ratcheting up efforts to ex-communicate Greene. Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) is introducing a privileged resolution to expel Greene from Congress, meaning it will receive a floor vote — potentially as early as next week.

But expulsion would require two-thirds support in the House, making it highly unlikely that it will succeed. Still, it will force every single lawmaker, including members of GOP leadership, to go on the record when it comes to Greene.

The freshman Republican from Georgia has drawn fury from across the House Democratic Caucus even before she was elected in November. But that anger grew far more intense in recent days, after CNN and Media Matters uncovered Facebook posts in which Greene spread lies that Sandy Hook and other deadly school shootings were staged. Another post showed Greene repeatedly endorsed executing top Democrats — including Pelosi herself — in 2018 and 2019.

Pelosi on Thursday signaled that she is putting the onus directly on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to act, who said through a spokesperson he plans to have a “conversation” with Greene about her “disturbing” comments. But so far, there are no signs that the California Republican has any intentions of stripping her of newly-awarded committee seats — even as at least one member of the GOP conference publicly demands that McCarthy take such a step.

Greene’s office said she has no plans to resign, citing strong and continued support from her constituents back home.

The fate of Greene is fueling tensions throughout the House, which remains on edge just three weeks after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Many Democrats say they are still rattled by the potential role of GOP members in that attack, including Greene, who helped lead the charge in a failed bid to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has been blamed even by some Republicans for helping to incite the insurrection. The House impeached former President Donald Trump for inciting the mob that stormed the Capitol.

Top Democrats, including Pelosi, have said that those GOP lawmakers’ roles in the riot are being investigated, and that members could face consequences if federal law enforcement finds that they were, indeed, involved in any planning.

“The enemy is within the House of Representatives,” Pelosi said. “We have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence against other members.”

In one sign of the palpable anger toward Greene, House Education Committee Chair Bobby Scott (D-Va.) took the unusual step of denouncing Greene’s appointment to his committee, citing her offensive comments about mass school shootings.

“House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy must explain how someone with this background represents the Republican party on education issues,” Scott wrote in a scathing statement Thursday.

Some Democrats aren’t waiting around for GOP leaders to act. Aside from Gomez's resolution, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) is preparing legislation to kick Greene off her committees if she is allowed to remain. While expulsion is unlikely, Democrats aren't ruling out additional measures against Greene.

“She shouldn’t have a public platform to further spread dangerous lies,” said Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), chair of the House Ethics Committee who represents Parkland, Fla., where teenagers were gunned down at a high school in 2018. Greene was also seen on video harassing a survivor of that shooting in a January 2019 video that recently resurfaced.

“Not on a House Committee. Not as a Member of Congress,” Deutch said.

The episode is just the latest Greene-induced headache for GOP leaders. After POLITICO last summer uncovered a trove of racist Facebook videos she made, McCarthy and other top Republicans raced to condemn Greene, who was still a congressional candidate at the time.

But then, to the frustration of many House Republicans, McCarthy did little to stop Greene from winning her primary. She then was welcomed into the GOP Conference with open arms, landing seats on the Education panel as well as the House Budget Committee, which will play a key role if Democrats use reconciliation to pass another coronavirus relief package. Greene has also joined the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who endorsed and boosted her candidacy.

McCarthy has urged lawmakers and the media to give Greene a chance, and has already had private conversations with her in an attempt to rein in some of her most extreme rhetoric. Greene did wind up denouncing QAnon, despite earlier embracing some of the movement’s far-right conspiracy theories.

And in recent days, Greene has been scrubbing her social media pages of past offensive remarks — a sign that she’s doing some damage control even as she hits back at critics of her past comments.

But with Democrats ramping up their push to punish Greene, McCarthy now finds himself in a dilemma. The GOP leader has shown he is willing to hold some lawmakers accountable who cross the line: In 2019, McCarthy stripped former Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) of his committee assignments for questioning why the term “white nationalism” was offensive. Yet King had a long history of incendiary remarks, and it took years for him to face any punishment. King also had few allies on the Hill; to the relief of many in the GOP, lost reelection last cycle in a primary.

Greene has been embraced by conservative hard-liners, and Trump has called her a “future Republican star.” McCarthy could face heat from the right if he tries to discipline her. She may also be likely unlikely to face consequences from Republican leaders anytime soon since the comments in question were made before her time in Congress. Plus, others in the GOP point out that such a move would only turn Greene into a martyr on the right.

Not everyone in the Republican Conference is standing by Greene. Freshman Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) has called her out in private conversations, while Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) has said Greene’s rhetoric could incite further insurrections and called her a “Republican In Name Only.”

“She may be like this new definition of Republican, but that's kind of a RINO thing,” Kinzinger said Thursday on CNN. “I don't think she should have the privilege of any committees.”

Democratic leaders, however, may be reluctant to crack down on Greene themselves. That could spur a tit-for-tat with Republicans, who may fire back with censure resolutions and other punitive measures of their own. Instead, Pelosi is trying to place responsibility for acting squarely with the GOP.

Still, Democrats are planning to use the GOP's embrace of Greene as a campaign issue in 2022 by trying to tie the entire party to QAnon.

“Minority Leader McCarthy and NRCC Chair Tom Emmer have not only caved to the mob and welcomed QAnon conspiracist Marjorie Taylor Green into their caucus, they’re putting her front and center as a key player,” said DCCC spokesperson Brooke Goren. “Americans have died at the hand of the QAnon mob, now vulnerable House Republicans will have to answer for that violence.”"	-15.18

House GOP leaders urged voters in Georgia's 14th Congressional District to pick someone else in the primary, wary of Greene's QAnon allegiance and documented history of racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-Muslim comments. After she prevailed in the primary, they pushed for her victory in the general election. She won.

Calls for Greene's ouster from the House started days after she was seated. And Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) said Wednesday he will introduce a measure to expel her, following new scrutiny of her social media history. CNN's KFILE got that ball rolling Tuesday.

Then the floodgates opened. Greene has called various deadly school shootings and the Las Vegas music festival massacre ""false flag"" events, questioned 9/11, and endorsed some foul QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories.

Marjorie Taylor Greene is into some seriously disturbed stuff here. The conspiracy theory she's promoting, ""Frazzledrip,"" is about Hillary Clinton torturing a baby and wearing its face as a mask. https://t.co/TpW382v9Bg — Will Sommer (@willsommer) January 26, 2021

Republican leaders are, once again, appalled. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Greene's posts are ""disgusting,"" have ""no place in our party"" and ""should be looked into,"" adding that ""QAnon is beyond fringe. I think it's dangerous."" Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) called Greene ""a RINO,"" or Republican in Name Only. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said through a spokesman that her comments are ""deeply disturbing"" and he ""plans to have a conversation with the congresswoman about them.""

In 2019, McCarthy stripped former Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) of all his committee assignments after he expressed support for white supremacists, AP reports. ""Greene was named this week to the House Education and Labor Committee."" CNN's Erin Burnett called that assignment doubly disturbing, given Greene's dismissal of school shootings, but said McCarthy knows some of the money Greene is raising off her outrages will go to the House GOP campaign committee.

Greene issued a weak and incredible non-denial denial of her social media activity, but the ""steady stream of revelations"" plus ""Greene's puzzling defense of herself should make Republicans wonder how long they can put up with this,"" Aaron Blake writes at The Washington Post. ""We tend to overestimate how much a politician like that can drag down their national party, but Greene's lack of remorse and candor reinforces how much of a loose cannon she could be moving forward.""

Axios has a small squib about “The Mischief Makers,” a handful of idiosyncratic congressional backbenchers who make trouble for their respective party leadership. The leading Democratic mischief-maker is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who advocates some left-wing views I consider simplistic and impractical and, in some cases, poll badly. The top example of a conservative mischief-maker, presented in perfect symmetry, is Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Greene’s views are just a bit more controversial. They include, but are by no means limited to, the following:

• The QAnon conspiracy theory, which holds that Donald Trump is secretly fighting a worldwide child-sex-slavery ring that was supposed to culminate in the mass arrest of his political opposition, is “worth listening to.”

• Muslims don’t belong in government.

• 9/11 was an inside job.

• Shootings at Parkland, Sandy Hook, and Las Vegas were staged.

• “Zionist supremacists” are secretly masterminding Muslim immigration to Europe in a scheme to outbreed white people.

• Leading Democratic officials should be executed.

The most recent Greene view to be unearthed comes via Eric Hananoki. Just over two years ago, Greene suggested in a Facebook post that wildfires in California were not natural. Forests don’t just catch fire, you know. Rather, the blazes had been started by PG&E, in conjunction with the Rothschilds, using a space laser, in order to clear room for a high-speed rail project. Here is Greene’s entire post, via Media Matters:

Photo: Marjorie Taylor Greene/Facebook

The Rothschild family has featured heavily in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories since at least the 19th century. Anti-Semites have generally updated the theory by replacing the Rothschilds with George Soros, a more contemporary and plausible-seeming mastermind for a global conspiracy to spread left-wing ideology. Greene’s version has instead updated the theory by giving the Rothschilds possession of a secret, powerful space laser.

Now, you might wonder why, if an international cabal of Jewish bankers wanted to finance a rail project, they would go about it by using their space lasers to set a catastrophic blaze. Aren’t there easier ways to get your rail stations approved by the state legislature? If you can pull off a massive conspiracy like that and keep it quiet, and you have a space laser you can use to immolate basically any target on Earth, there have to be more direct profit-making opportunities than burning down trees in order to arbitrage the land value for a public-transit contract.

You’re probably not going to get Greene’s answer, though, because the last news crew that showed up at one of her events was threatened with arrest by the local sheriff.

Anyway, it is true that Marjorie Taylor Greene and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez play equivalent roles within their respective parties. MTG holds down her party’s right flank, and AOC holds down her party’s left flank. You can somewhat deduce the corresponding beliefs of the two parties’ mainstream contingents by moving somewhat to the center of each. Most Democrats are skeptical of defunding the police and question the feasibility of transitioning to a state-run health-care system. Most Republicans are probably quite skeptical that the California wildfires were intentionally set by a Jewish space laser.

The thing is, you can be much more moderate than MTG, and still be extremely crazy."	-15.18

"During previously unreported meetings last summer, House Republican leaders discussed — but then largely set aside — fears that QAnon-supporting conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene would end up a flaming trainwreck for their party.

Why it matters: Greene has emerged not just as an embarrassment but a challenge for the GOP, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy now forced to weigh whether to maintain his policy of sanctioning members who make dangerous statements.

In a series of conversations described to Axios by sources with direct knowledge of their contents, former Rep. Mark Walker was especially vocal about the ""crazy"" Greene. Reps. Liz Cheney and Steve Scalise also spoke up. But McCarthy and others ultimately did little to stop her.

A spokesperson for Greene did not respond to a call or email from Axios.

Behind the scenes: John Cowan, Greene's opponent in August's primary runoff for Georgia's 14th District seat, recalls separate conversations he had with McCarthy and Scalise, the House GOP whip, in which both men acknowledged Greene was a serious problem for the party.

Cowan detailed a phone conversation he had with McCarthy in July, during which he warned him about wild opposition research they had against Greene.

""I said, 'She's bad for the party,'"" Cowan told Axios during a 30-minute interview Thursday. ""I said she has real problems and does not represent, at least what I think of as, someone who would be allowed even in a big-tented party. I mean, at some point, you have to say, 'No shoes, no shirt, no service.'""

While both McCarthy and Scalise condemned Greene, and Scalise endorsed and raised money for and donated to Cowan, it wasn't enough to overcome the vocal support for Greene from Trump's then-chief of staff Mark Meadows.

The backing of Meadows, his wife, Debbie, and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio was so strong that Cowan never had a real shot against Greene, he said.

""The House Freedom Caucus put their fingers on the scale in a big way,"" said Cowan, a neurosurgeon. ""By default it was sort of, 'She must be Trump's person.' If those guys are going to bat for her, she must be Trump’s endorsed person.”

Greene also came up repeatedly during McCarthy's leadership meetings last summer, a source with direct knowledge told Axios.

Scalise, Cheney and Walker gathered for the weekly meeting in the conference room of McCarthy's office in the Capitol and plotted how they should deal with her.

Walker, now running for North Carolina's open Senate seat in 2022, strenuously argued they needed to do more to stop this ""crazy"" woman who threatened to bring down the party, according to a source with direct knowledge.

Cheney (R-Wyo.) also spoke up aggressively in these meetings about the danger of having Greene in the party.

Scalise (R-La.) and McCarthy (R-Calif.) ended up putting out statements condemning her, yet McCarthy didn't do much beyond that once it was clear she was going to win the race by a healthy margin.

The bottom line: ""Everybody was well aware of her previous persona and who she is. I would say they all knew she was going to be a problem,"" Cowan told Axios."	-15.18
"GM hopes to eliminate gas vehicles in favor of all-electric vehicle lineup by 2040

Jamie L. LaReau | Detroit Free Press

Show Caption Hide Caption GM unveils new logo, plans new website in shift to electric vehicles GM unveils a new marketing campaign, a new logo and will have a new website as it moves forward to become an all-electric car maker. General Motors

DETROIT – General Motors ""aspires"" to have all of its global new light-duty vehicles – including full-size pickups and SUVs – be zero-emission by 2035. The carmaker also wants its global products and plants to be carbon neutral by 2040.

GM made the announcement Thursday, stopping short of saying all of its vehicles will be zero-emission, which means either battery-electric or hydrogen fuel cell propulsion.

Carbon-neutral means that all vehicles and plants will be zero-emission and GM will buy carbon credits to offset those that are not.

"" 'Aspire' is a great word because it helps us work toward our vision,"" said Dane Parker, GM's chief sustainability officer. ""We're taking action to have our vehicles be zero- emission by 2035. This is going to take the effort of a lot of people and a lot of governments to get there. So we have a vision, we have a plan and we're taking action today to get there.""

Parker said GM's global plan for zero-emission vehicles includes heavy-duty pickups by 2040. Put simply, Parker said, “By 2040, 100% of our portfolio will be fully electric and that’s the vision we’re setting out.”

Parker said GM also signed the Business Ambition Pledge for 1.5-degree Celsius, which is a call by a global coalition of United Nation agencies, business and industry leaders to protect the environment.

“General Motors is joining governments and companies around the globe working to establish a safer, greener and better world,” said GM CEO Mary Barra in a statement. “We encourage others to follow suit.”

'Extraordinary step forward'

GM will offer zero-emissions vehicles across a range of prices and it is working with all its stakeholders, including suppliers and the Environmental Defense Fund, to build charging infrastructure and promote consumer acceptance.

Parker said this path will not eliminate jobs.

“We plan on using the resources we have and allocating them in a way that supports our EV future and bringing the high-paying jobs we have today into the future,” Parker said.

Also, GM foresees today's gas stations converting to tomorrow's charging stations. Already in other countries, gas stations are being repurposed to public fast-charging points, and ""that's a trend that I would see growing,"" Parker said.

The Environmental Defense Fund calls GM's move an ""extraordinary step forward.""

""GM is making it crystal clear that taking action to eliminate pollution from all new light-duty vehicles by 2035 is an essential element of any automaker’s business plan,"" said Fred Krupp, Fund president, in a statement.

But one industry observer said this is not solely a sustainability play. It's a savvy business move.

""The future of mobility is electric. Tesla set the pace but others are getting into the game,"" said Andrew Hoffman, professor of sustainable enterprise at University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. ""Ford has notably made a serious play in electrics, VW had a false start. GM has to be in this to be viable going forward.""

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Dearborn) said GM's announcement signals that the auto industry is committed to tackling the global climate crisis.

""We have had discussions for months with the auto industry, labor unions, and the environmental community on concrete actions like this that must be taken to reach carbon neutrality,” Dingell said. “I will continue to engage with all stakeholders to create an electric vehicle infrastructure to support these efforts and help our domestic auto industry compete globally.”

A greener world

About 200 countries have signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, which the U.S. rejoined on President Joe Biden’s first day in office. It sets a collective goal to limit global warming to below 2-degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5-degree Celsius, compared with preindustrial levels, to mitigate climate change damage.

To meet that goal, the world must reduce the net impact of carbon emissions from all human activities to zero by 2050, Barra said.

""As one of the world’s largest automakers, General Motors seeks to lead our industry and our world toward those goals,"" Barra said. ""For General Motors, our most significant carbon impact comes from tailpipe emissions of the vehicles that we sell — in our case, it’s 75%. That is why it is so important that we accelerate toward a future in which every vehicle we sell is a zero-emissions vehicle.""

Barra told Wall Street late last year that GM will offer 30 new all-electric vehicles globally by 2025, that means 40% of the company’s U.S. models offered would be EVs.

GM's investment in electric

GM is also working to cut emissions from its global manufacturing plants. It is investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles by 2025, up from the $20 billion GM had planned to invest before the pandemic.

This investment will pay to further develop GM’s Ultium battery technology, which will underpin its new electric vehicles.

Also, it covers updating GM factories such as Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck where GM is planning to build at least five electric vehicles in the future, the first being the 2022 GMC Hummer EV pickup due out later this year.

Also, GM is retooling its Spring Hill Manufacturing in Tennessee to build electric vehicles from globally sourced parts.

GM is investing in new factories too such as Ultium Cells LLC near its former assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM sold the Lordstown plant to electric pickup maker Lordstown Motors, which will launch the Endurance pickup later this year.

Beyond environmentally friendly cars and factories, GM plans for 100% of its electric vehicle batteries to be reused as other forms of energy storage. The Ultium system, for example, is designed to be repairable, so “we don’t intend for any of our batteries to be disposable,"" Parker said.

GM said more than half of its capital spending and product development team will be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs.

While GM said it plans ""to offer an EV for every customer, from crossovers and SUVs to trucks and sedans,"" it will continue to increase fuel efficiency of its traditional internal combustion cars with technology such as Stop/Start, better aerodynamics, smaller, boosted engines, more efficient transmissions and other vehicle improvements including weight reduction and lower rolling resistance tires.

Using renewable energy

To address emissions from its own operations, GM said it will source 100% renewable energy to power its U.S. sites by 2030 and global sites by 2035, which represents a five-year acceleration of the company’s previously announced global goal.

To account for the expected remaining carbon emissions, GM expects to invest in carbon credits or offsets, it said.

GM said it will assess these ""offset solutions"" in the coming years, adding that ""offsets must be used sparingly.""

GM has worked with some of its largest suppliers to create a sustainability council to share best practices. GM is also collaborating with suppliers to set targets for the supply chain to reduce emissions and use more sustainable materials.

It is also important that electricity generated to charge EVs comes from renewable sources like wind and solar, so GM has worked with utilities and developers to support investments in renewable energy near GM facilities via power purchase agreements and green tariffs.

Finally, GM partnered with EVgo last year to add more than 2,700 new fast chargers by the end of 2025, to help accelerate consumer electric vehicle adoption. The new fast chargers will be powered by 100% renewable energy.

"General Motors CEO Mary Barra threw President Trump under the electric car Monday, announcing in a letter to environmental groups that GM will no longer support the Trump administration's battle to strip California of its own clean-air standards and signaling the automaker is ready to work with President-elect Joe Biden on climate policy.

""President-elect Biden recently said, 'I believe that we can own the 21st century car market again by moving to electric vehicles.' We at General Motors couldn't agree more,"" Barra wrote. ""We believe the ambitious electrification goals of the president-elect, California, and General Motors are aligned, to address climate change by drastically reducing automobile emissions."" GM announced last week that it's testing a new battery chemistry that should bring its electric vehicles to the same price range as gas-powered ones within five years.

Barra urged Toyota, Fiat-Chrysler, and the 10 smaller automakers that had sided with Trump to flip sides, too, and Toyota said it is ""assessing the situation"" and mostly wants uniform fuel standards in all 50 states.

""GM's maneuvering was a public humiliation to Mr. Trump,"" The New York Times reports. ""Barra gave no warning to the administration, but she did speak by telephone on Monday with Mary Nichols, California's top climate regulator and an architect of the Obama-era fuel economy rules."" Two people familiar with Barra's thinking told the Times her actions were clearly prompted by the outcome of the presidential race, but ""even so, the way she did it took analysts aback.""

Trump reversed President Barack Obama's national fuel standards upon taking office, lowering the target to 40 miles per gallon by 2025 from 54.5 mpg. California then quietly reached a deal with Honda, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Volvo to get to 51 mpg by 2026, enraging Trump, who then moved in September 2019 to revoke California's unique ability to set its own tailpipe emission standards. GM and its allied automakers sided with Trump when environmental groups sued to block that move. The 51 mpg compromise ""is now seen as the likely model for a new, Biden-era fuel economy rule,"" the Times reports.

""This huge pivot, so closely following an election result, particularly from a firm like General Motors, is a big, big deal,"" said University of Michigan public policy professor Barry Rabe. ""This is the first big industrial step toward the next president. Are other industries going to have epiphanies and pivot?"" Peter Weber"	-15.18

(Patrick Rocca/Nucleus Network/ABC via AP)

Novavax Inc. said Thursday that its COVID-19 vaccine appears 89% effective based on early findings from a British study and that it also seems to work — though not as well — against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in that country and South Africa.

The announcement comes amid worry about whether a variety of vaccines being rolled out around the world will be strong enough to protect against worrisome new variants – and as the world desperately needs new types of shots to boost scarce supplies.

The study of 15,000 people in Britain is still underway. But an interim analysis found 62 participants so far have been diagnosed with COVID-19 – only six of them in the group that got vaccine and the rest who received dummy shots.

ADVERTISEMENT

The infections occurred at a time when Britain was experiencing a jump in COVID-19 caused by a more contagious variant. A preliminary analysis found over half of the trial participants who became infected had the mutated version. The numbers are very small, but Novavax said they suggest the vaccine is nearly 96% effective against the older coronavirus and nearly 86% effective against the new variant. The findings are based on cases that occurred at least a week after the second dose.

“Both those numbers are dramatic demonstrations of the ability of our vaccine to develop a very potent immune response,” Novavax CEO Stanley Erck said in a call with investors late Thursday.

Scientists have been even more worried about a variant first discovered in South Africa that carries different mutations. Results from a smaller Novavax study in that country suggests the vaccine does work but not nearly as well as it does against the variant from Britain.

The South African study included some volunteers with HIV. Among the HIV-negative volunteers, the vaccine appears 60% effective. Including volunteers with HIV, overall the protection was 49%, the company said. While genetic testing still is underway, so far about 90% of the COVID-19 illnesses found in the South African study appear due to the new mutant.

“These are good results. There is reason to be optimistic” about the 60% effectiveness, said Glenda Gray, head of the South African Medical Research Council. Even against the new variant that now causes more than 90% of new cases in that country, “we’re still seeing vaccine efficacy,” she said.

More concerning is what the study showed about a totally different question — the chances of people getting COVID-19 a second time, said the leader of the South African study, Shabir Madhi of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Tests suggested that nearly a third of study participants had been previously infected, yet rates of new infections in the placebo group were similar.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

“Past infection with early variants of the virus in South Africa does not protect” against infection with the new one, he said. “There doesn’t seem to be any protection derived.”

Novavax said it needs some additional data before it can seek British authorization for the vaccine’s use, sometime in the next month or so. A larger study in the U.S. and Mexico has enrolled slightly over half of the needed 30,000 volunteers. Novavax said it’s not clear if the Food and Drug Administration will need data from that study, too, before deciding whether to allow U.S. use.

Meanwhile, it is starting to develop a version of the vaccine that could more specifically target the mutations found in South Africa, in case health authorities eventually decide that updated dosing is needed.

Vaccines against COVID-19 train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, mostly the spike protein that coats it. But the Novavax candidate is made differently than the first shots being used. Called a recombinant protein vaccine, the Maryland company uses genetic engineering to grow harmless copies of the coronavirus spike protein in insect cells. Scientists extract and purify the protein and then mix in an immune-boosting chemical.

"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18

Rita Ora was so desperate for a 30th birthday party amid London’s lockdown in November, she was willing to pay a hefty price.

Police claim a rep for Ora called restaurant Casa Cruz and offered the boss, Scottie Bhattarai, £5,000 or $6,829 to provide “drinks and nibbles” for a party, The U.K. Sun reported. As most of the restaurant’s staff had been furloughed due to the pandemic, Bhattarai wanted to “facilitate” and admitted he was “greedy.”

Bhattarai reportedly told police only seven guests were expected to arrive but by 9 p.m. local time almost 20 people showed up, including model Cara Delevingne and her sister Poppy.

His statement also noted that guests, including Ora, supplied their own alcohol and that entourage security wanted no footage of the event, so he shut off the cameras.

Bhattarai declined to name the rep who arranged the soiree. He has since been removed from his job.

Rita Ora later apologized for the birthday party, which violated lockdown rules. MEGA

A rep for Ora didn’t immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.

Casa Cruz’s owner, Nicholas Fallows, told The Sun after the party was busted by cops that he hadn’t known about the party, as the spot is “owned by shareholders.”

This assessment is in addition to the USCP’s Inspector General’s review of the events of January 6, 2021, and the third-party review of the Complex’s physical infrastructure, processes, and command and control being conducted at the behest of Speaker Pelosi by retired Lt.

“In light of recent events, I can unequivocally say that vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure must be made to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, back-up forces in close proximity to the Capitol.

The bulletin comes three weeks after supporters of former President Donald Trump, who falsely claimed he won the 2020 presidential election, stormed the Capitol building in a violet riot to disrupt Congress' certification of the election results.

""Information suggests that some ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence,"" DHS said.

The DHS also said it's concerned that extremists ""may be emboldened"" by the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol building, though it added that domestic extremists have been ""motivated by a range of issues, including anger over COVID-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results, and police use of force.""

The last such advisory issued by DHS using this alert system was related to a potential threat from Iran following a U.S. strike that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020, ABC News reports. The White House last week announced that Biden has ordered a threat assessment focused on domestic extremism to be conducted in coordination with DHS in the wake of the Capitol riot.

""The January 6 assault on the Capitol and the tragic deaths and destruction that occurred underscored what we have long known: the rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national security threat,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. Brendan Morrow"	-15.18
"The acting chief of the U.S. Capitol Police has offered an apology to lawmakers following the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol building, acknowledging the department ""should have been more prepared.""

Yogananda Pittman, the acting Capitol Police chief, apologized to Congress during a closed-door briefing on Tuesday for ""our failings"" during the riot at the Capitol that left five people dead earlier this month, The New York Times reports.

""On Jan. 6, in the face of a terrorist attack by tens of thousands of insurrectionists determined to stop the certification of Electoral College votes, the department failed to meet its own high standards as well as yours,"" Pittman said, according to remarks obtained by the Times. ""We fully expect to answer to you and the American people for our failings on Jan. 6. I am here to offer my sincerest apologies on behalf of the department.""

Supporters of former President Donald Trump breached the Capitol building as lawmakers met to certify President Biden's election win. Pittman told Congress that Capitol Police ""should have been more prepared for this attack"" and that prior to the riot, ""we knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.""

""The department prepared in order to meet these challenges, but we did not do enough,"" Pittman acknowledged, also praising the officers who ""performed valiantly"" during the attack as ""heroes.""

The apology from Pittman, who the Times notes wasn't serving as acting chief when the Capitol attack occurred, comes as CNN reports that Capitol Police officers are discussing potentially holding a no-confidence vote against department leaders who were working on the day of the pro-Trump riot. A source told CNN, ""The rank-and-file of this department has no faith in any of our chiefs, especially the ones in that were here on Jan. 6."" Brendan Morrow"	-15.18
"Potomac, Maryland — This past April, Ric Jackson helped a neighbor who was looking for someone to fix the brakes on his daughter's bicycle.

""I fixed it up. He took it back. And she was thrilled and he was thrilled,"" Jackson said. ""And it's just mushroomed.""

The avid cyclist and retired mathematician has since fixed more than 650 bikes for friends, neighbors, even strangers.

He charges nothing for this labor of love, but says he gets a lot in return. Especially the looks on children's faces when they see their old bikes transformed.

When he looks at a bike he says he sees ""a thing of beauty.""

""If you clean off the dirt from the tires, put new handgrips on,"" he said, ""before you know it, it will be … something that will just delight the heart of some little girl someplace.""

One father sent Jackson this text: ""Thank you for the wonderful gift today. We had a great daddy-daughter bike ride and she was all smiles.""

""That's the kind of thing that makes my day,"" Jackson said. ""That's my reward.""

And during times like these, there might be no better reward than the smile of a child."	-15.18

"(CNN) In an epic cleanup effort, volunteers removed more than 9,000 pounds of trash from the Tennessee River, one of the dirtiest rivers in the country.

Over the course of three days earlier this month, volunteers with Keep the Tennessee River Beautiful and Johnsonville State Historic Park rid the river of 9,208 pounds of trash, using a 25-foot aluminum work boat to traverse the river and clean shorelines, a news release stated

""That's how the change for our river will happen: through local partners and individuals who are eager about taking ownership to protect and improve their beautiful river community,"" said Kathleen Gibi, executive director of Keep the Tennessee River Beautiful. ""It's been truly inspiring for us to see these change makers take action -- especially with the local leadership from Johnsonville State Historic Park.""

The team led another cleanup in October, when they collected 4,811 pounds of trash. And there's still more to be cleaned; the team is planning another event in April and aims to collect 100,000 pounds of trash from the river by the end of the year.

The Tennessee River, a 652-mile tributary of the Ohio River, is notoriously polluted. In 2019, researchers said the river was more like a river of plastic, according to CNN affiliate WVLT , possibly with more broken down bits of plastic than any other river in the world.

"A third member of law enforcement, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, died from injuries he sustained during the Capitol attack.

“We honor the service and sacrifices of Officers Brian Sicknick, Howard Liebengood, and Jeffery Smith, and offer condolences to all the grieving families,” Contee said in his testimony.

The report of an additional officer’s death once again shook Capitol Hill, where many members and staff are still reeling in the three weeks since the insurrection. Five people died as a result of the riots, and two officers later died by suicide — a death toll that has horrified lawmakers of both parties and led them to demand answers from Capitol security officials.

Congress is still grappling with the political ramifications of the events of Jan. 6, with the Senate in the early stages of an impeachment trial against former President Donald Trump. But lawmakers are also deep into an investigation into the many security lapses that left so many Capitol Police and MPD officers outnumbered and vulnerable to attack by the mob.

Lawmakers heard from law enforcement officials for the first time about the Capitol security breaches during the briefing with the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, when Yogananda D. Pittman, the acting head of the U.S. Capitol Police, said the department was outmanned and unprepared for the attack.

Pittman also admitted that the Capitol Police Board denied a request on Jan. 4 for additional support from the National Guard. It wasn’t until the building was overrun by a pro-Trump mob the panel relented, an hour after another plea was made.

Appropriators left the briefing with a number of questions — chiefly, that intelligence agencies had “ample evidence an angry mob would descend on Washington” and they failed to “act on this intelligence or adequately prepare for the looming threat,” House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said in a statement after the briefing.

Contee told appropriators that about 850 MPD officers responded to the riot and 65 members sustained documented injuries.

“Many more sustained injuries from the assault — scratches, bruises, eyes burning from bear mace — that they did not even bother to report,” he said.

MPD’s estimate for the response totals about $8.8 million, he said.

“The costs for this insurrection — both human and monetary — will be steep,” Contee said. “The immediate fiscal impact is still being calculated.”

"COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus with single positive-stranded RNA. This virus has the potential to jump from animals to humans.8 Previously, two epidemics caused by this virus family have resulted in thousands of deaths, the SARS pandemic and the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. This new coronavirus, also called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can rapidly spread via respiratory droplets. COVID-19 was first identified in China in late December 2019 but was assumed to have started at the beginning of December or even earlier when it was treated as pneumonia of an unknown origin. On February 26, 2020, the first case was identified in the US, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 disease a pandemic, which is still currently the case globally. By early November 2020, the WHO has already reported 1.2 million deaths, and around 49 million confirmed cases globally.9

A meta-analysis by Salari et al. 14 examined 17 cross-sectional studies of the general population in Europe and Asia that showed “the prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression, as a result of the pandemic in the general population, are 29.6%, 31.9%, and 33.7%, respectively.” Furthermore, people are also suffering with signs and symptoms of psychosis, anxiety, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and suicidal thought. 14

“Excessive health anxiety,” a term used to describe extreme fear of contracting the disease and misinterpretation of unrelated bodily symptoms, further exacerbated the feeling of distress and anxiety that consequently resulted in sleep disturbance. 11 Past epidemiological studies showed that people with distress and anxiety disorders were at a much higher risk for sleep disturbances, the second most common symptom of mental distress. 12 Sleep disturbances have long been linked to a host of mental health disorders and suicidal ideation. In a survey conducted during the first few weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, Killgore at al. 13 showed that 56% reported at least some evidence of insomnia, with 30.9% in the subthreshold range, 19.8% in the moderate range, and 5.2% in the severe range, levels much higher than historically seen in the general population. The study also suggested that anxiety related to COVID-19 is a significant contributor to the increased incidence of suicidal ideation. 13 Incidence of depression has also escalated during the pandemic because a large part of the population has faced multiple medical, social, and economic stressors, including job loss, social isolation, disruption of routine, fear of unknowns, and loss of loved ones due to COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented global public health crisis along with its social and economic upheaval. Apart from physical suffering, the pandemic also directly and indirectly inflicted psychological suffering on many people. Like past outbreaks, in the early stage of the pandemic, the news of this largely unknown infection created fear and anxiety that swiftly crossed all borders. Anxiety and distress further intensified when the virus spread globally in just a few months. Although restrictive measures such as social distancing, social isolation, and quarantine helped flatten the curve within a few months after the initial outbreak, they were linked to feelings of uncertainty, sensorial deprivation, pervasive loneliness, anger, frustration, and boredom. Disabling loneliness and sleep disturbances are significantly associated with depression and suicidal behavior. 10

Risks for Suicide During COVID-19 Pandemic

Unemployment and financial loss. Financial loss and employment are considered pertinent factors for suicide.15 Owing to the pandemic, the introduction of lockdown resulted in a spike in the unemployment rate globally. With the US unemployment rate skyrocketing to 14.4% in April 2020, tens of millions of people either lost their jobs or were forced to take a pay cut.16

It has been proven historically that economic turndowns result in increases in mental health disorders and suicidal tendencies. A previous study demonstrated that unemployment from 2000 to 2011 increased suicide risk by 20% to 30%.17 People who do not feel secure in their employment tend to be at greater risk for depression, and unemployment increases their risk of alcohol use and suicide.18

Reeves et al.19 reported that most European and North American countries experienced increasing suicide rates during the 2008 to 2010 recession. The authors of the study calculated approximately 10,000 “economic suicides” during the recession in the European Union, Canada, and the US.19 It is reasonable to expect further economic decline during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to have a detrimental effect on mental health and suicidal behavior.

Social isolation. The stringent lockdown guidelines meant severe social isolation for most people. Loneliness and isolation are also considered important risk factors for several mental health disorders including depression, anxiety, chronic stress, insomnia, and late-life dementia.20 Loneliness, commonly seen among older adults, is responsible for increasing depression rates and suicidality. Damaging effects on mental well-being due to prolonged periods of isolation in nursing homes or quarantine have been well studied and reported.21 The lockdown measures also worsened rates of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and insomnia in the general population and contributed to fatigue and reduced performance in health care workers. Before the pandemic, loneliness and isolation were already quite prevalent across Europe, China, and the US (10%–40%), labeled as the “behavioral epidemic,” and essential lockdown measures to help curve the virus had the effect of worsening the already bad state of affairs.22 Furthermore, the isolation may also cause worsening of depressive symptoms, a deterioration in the perception of one's health, decreased functionality, impaired vision, and negative perception of one's own life. Systematic reviews of suicide risk have already demonstrated that loneliness is correlated with suicide attempts as well as its completion among the vulnerable populations.23

Alcohol. Social isolation and stress because of the pandemic may serve as a trigger for alcohol use, which in turn may cause a spike in alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related harms. The 2003 SARS outbreak caused a spike in alcohol abuse dependence symptoms in hospital employees who were exposed to the outbreak. Alcohol and its increased consumption correlate with a rise in domestic violence during the pandemic, increased risk of harm to children, and increased risk of suicide, not to mention worsening other mental health issues.24 Although confinement and its effect on prevalence of alcohol consumption are widely debated, the increasing use of alcohol is likely probable and can favor the passage to the suicidal act.25

Firearms. Any increase in gun ownership among the general population tends to correlate with an increase in risk for suicide with firearms. In February 2020, when lockdown measures were imposed, firearm sales rocketed in the US, with 2.5 million firearms being sold within March 2020 alone, 1.5 million of which were handguns.26 The presence of firearms and their greater availability put people at a higher risk for suicide or its completion. It is important to note that the presence of a firearm in a home poses a 2- to 10-fold increased risk compared with the absence of firearms.27

Whenever a person purchases a gun, within the first year of the purchase, the owner has a 22-fold increase in the rate of firearm-related suicide compared to those who do not purchase a handgun.28 With almost every 10% increase in household ownership, we see a rise in the firearm suicide rate of about 3.1 per 100,000 persons.28

It is necessary to mention that, with most mechanisms of suicide, completion is not commonly achieved; however, one exception is firearm-related suicide whose fatality is 40 times greater than that of drug poisoning, which is the most common method of suicide.29"	-15.18

The age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States in 2017 (14.0 per 100,000 standard population) was 33% higher than the rate in 1999 (10.5) (1). This NCHS Health E-Stat provides supplemental information on suicide rates by sex, age, and race and ethnicity.

For females, age-adjusted suicide rates increased significantly between 1999 and 2017 for all race and ethnicity groups except non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander (API). The largest increase occurred for non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) females (139%, from 4.6 to 11.0) (Figure 1, Table). In 2017, for the three age groups for which reliable rates could be computed for all race and ethnicity groups (15–24, 25–44, and 45–64), rates for females aged 15–24 and 25–44 were highest for non-Hispanic AIAN females (20.5 and 20.7, respectively). For females aged 45–64, the rate was highest for non-Hispanic white females (12.8).

For males, age-adjusted suicide rates increased significantly between 1999 and 2017 for all race and ethnicity groups except non-Hispanic API, with the largest increase observed among non-Hispanic AIAN males (71%, from 19.8 to 33.8) (Figure 2, Table). In 2017, for the three age groups for which reliable rates could be calculated for all race and ethnicity groups, rates for males aged 15–24 and 25–44 were highest for non-Hispanic AIAN males (53.7 and 58.1, respectively). For males aged 45–64, the rate was highest for non-Hispanic white males (38.2).

Studies have shown that deaths for all causes for non-Hispanic AIAN, non-Hispanic API, and Hispanic persons are sometimes misclassified to other race and ethnicity groups, resulting in an underestimation of deaths by about 33%, 3%, and 3%, respectively (2). The specific extent and direction of misclassification of suicide deaths is unknown; however, the number of suicide deaths for these race and ethnicity groups may also be underestimated. Nevertheless, non-Hispanic AIAN persons had the highest suicide rates for both females and males aged 15–24 and 25–44 in 2017.

Data source and methods

Data are from the National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death files for 1999 and 2017 (3). Suicides were classified using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD–10) underlying cause of death codes U03, X60–X84, and Y87.0 (4).

Age-adjusted death rates were calculated using the direct method and the 2000 U.S. standard population (4). Age-specific death rates were computed for the groups in which the number of suicides was 20 or more, below which the rates are not considered statistically reliable. Population data for 1999 and 2017 are July 1 bridged-race estimates from the Vintage 2017 intercensal and postcensal series. Statistical significance of differences in rates was assessed using a z test. All differences mentioned were significant at the 0.05 level.

"The reminders of pandemic-driven suffering among students in Clark County, Nev., have come in droves.

Since schools shut their doors in March, an early-warning system that monitors students’ mental health episodes has sent more than 3,100 alerts to district officials, raising alarms about suicidal thoughts, possible self-harm or cries for care. By December, 18 students had taken their own lives.

The spate of student suicides in and around Las Vegas has pushed the Clark County district, the nation’s fifth largest, toward bringing students back as quickly as possible. This month, the school board gave the green light to phase in the return of some elementary school grades and groups of struggling students even as greater Las Vegas continues to post huge numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths.

Superintendents across the nation are weighing the benefit of in-person education against the cost of public health, watching teachers and staff become sick and, in some cases, die, but also seeing the psychological and academic toll that school closings are having on children nearly a year in. The risk of student suicides has quietly stirred many district leaders, leading some, like the state superintendent in Arizona, to cite that fear in public pleas to help mitigate the virus’s spread."	-15.18
"Donald G. Tober, CEO of Sugar Foods Corporation and Sweet'N Low magnate, died Friday, according to The New York Post.

Tober, 89, had been a driving force behind Sweet'N Low, the little pink packets of artificial sweetener.

""He was bigger than life,"" Steve Odell, Tober's business partner of 51 years, told the Post.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The man who helped put pink Sweet'N Low packets on millions of tables died on Friday.

Donald G. Tober, chairman of Sugar Foods Corporation, had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, according to the report.

According to a report in The New York Post, the 89-year-old died after jumping from his Manhattan apartment building.

Sugar Foods, which has about 1,400 employees in New York, had marketed Sweet'N Low and other well-known brands, including N'Joy coffee creamers and Sugar in the Raw. The company stopped marketing Sweet'N Low about 15 years ago, according to the Post.

""He was bigger than life,"" Steve Odell, Tober's business partner of 51 years, told the Post.

He said: ""Don's had as much to do with building Sweet'N Low into a household name as anyone ever has with a product. Every packet of Sweet'N Low sold today can be traced back to a single sales call that he probably made or at least had a part in.""

Sweet'N Low was created in 1957 by Ben Eisenstadt, who had run a cafeteria in Brooklyn, according to the artificial sweetener's official history. By the 1990s, when Tober was involved, it was estimated that about 86% of food-service outlets had Sweet'N Low on hand, according to a 1996 report from The Denver Post.

In the early 1980s, Sweet'N Low had to deal with a new competitor, NutraSweet's Equal, which came in blue packets. Both are popular artificial sweeteners, used in place of sugar.

Tober hatched a plan to keep Sweet'N Low relevant by running a Great Waiter Contest, according to The Denver Post report. His company put a call for nominations on 5 million Sweet'N Low boxes, and got about 3,000 essays in return, according to the report.

""Concentrating on waiters and waitresses was very important to us,"" Tober told the newspaper at the time. ""The wait staff can be a sales arm for us.""

During a blizzard in New York City in January 1996, Tober talked with a reporter from The New York Daily News. He said he'd lost tens of thousands of dollars because of the storm, which kept people inside and restaurants closed.

Tober told the newspaper: ""My wife woke up today and talked about how beautiful it was. I said not for the economy.""

Tober met his wife, Barbara D. Tober, in 1972 and married a year later, according to a 1992 profile in The Commercial Appeal, a newspaper in Memphis, Tennessee.

In that report, she recalled one of their early conversations: '' 'Are you always so even tempered?' I asked him. 'What you see is what you get,' he said, and I knew he was the man for me. He's filled with energy, and men with energy have always been attracted to me.''

Barbara had been editor-in-chief at Bride's Magazine for about 30 years, according to a profile of the couple in The New Jewish Home.

Both were involved in philanthropy in New York City, where Donald Tober had co-founded the Citymeals nn Wheels program, according to the report. He was an avid equestrian and skier, according to the American Austrian Foundation, where he was a trustee.

"A West Virginia mother gunned down her five young children before burning down her house and turning the gun on herself in December, officials said this week.

Oreanna Myers, 25 left a confessional suicide note in which she wrote she was not strong enough to defeat her “demons,” and apologized for her “evil crime,” law enforcement officials said Thursday.

The horrific Dec. 8 massacre left Myers’ three sons and two stepchildren from her husband’s previous marriage dead. The children were identified as Shaun Dawson Bumgarner, 7, Riley James Bumgarner, 6, Kian Myers, 4, Aarikyle Nova Myers, 3, and Haiken Jirachi Myers, 1.

Myers was suffering from depression and was upset that her husband had been staying with his father for two weeks instead of with her and the children at their home outside Williamsburg, W.Va., due to logistical transportation issues, Greenbrier County Sheriff Bruce Sloan said Thursday.

The grim timeline began when Myers picked up two of her sons from the bus stop at the end of the school day on the December Tuesday with a red line drawn across her face.

When asked by her children if she was bleeding, Myers replied that she drew it, witnesses told investigators.

An hour later, firefighters responded to a 911 call at the family home and found the house fully engulfed in flames.

After extinguishing the flames, the bodies of the young victims were found inside the home with shotgun wounds to the head. Myers was found dead outside the home near a picnic table, with the murder weapon lying by her side.

Officials said the weapon was not automatic, meaning Myers had to reload the shotgun before each deadly blast.

Sloan said text messages sent in the week before the tragedy between Myers and her husband showed that Bumgarner’s work-related absence was the source of a heated disagreement between the couple.

“Don’t worry about this piece of [expletive] anymore. You’ll have nothing to come back to but to corpse [sic]. You choosing money over my depression shows I am [expletive]. No one cares why should I?” read one of the desperate texts Myers sent to her husband.

“Money will come and go, once I go there’s no replacing me. I beg and cry for help but never get it. It’s my mental health that needs tending to–help me– I do not care anymore.”

Myers left several notes to her husband denoting her guilt.

“I’m so sorry Brian,” one read. “I was not strong enough for you or this family. My head is so (expletive). I’m sorry for my evil crime. I was not strong enough to fight these demons, Snap. Crunch, Boom. So depressed. Heart numb. Soul completely shattered. I am sorry I failed you. I am sorry I failed our handsome boys. I am so sorry I was not strong enough. OAM.”

“I had shot all of the boys in the head. I had set house on fire. I had shot myself in the head. I’m sorry,” she wrote.

“Mental health is serious. I hope one day someone will help others like me. Mental health is not to joke about or taken lightly. When someone begs, pleads, cries out for help, please help them. You just might save a life or more lives. Thank you, OAM.”

Sloan said he was unaware whether Myers was being treated for mental illness.

According to a heartbreaking joint obituary for four of the young victims, Shaun was “interested in space and wanted to be an astronaut.”

Riley was a budding musician who “was learning to play the piano and the ukulele.”

Aarikyle was a young artist who “loved Ninja Turtles and superheroes.”

One-year-old Haiken was “spoiled by all and loved driving his toy cars.”

Sloane said the case is closed and is urging family members of anyone suffering from depression or expressing suicidal thoughts to seek help immediately.

Anyone suffering from suicidal thoughts is urged to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255."	-15.18
"Dr. Traxler: We Must All Recommit to Stopping the Spread – Wear a Mask, Stay Six Feet Apart

COLUMBIA, S.C. — The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) announced today the detection of two cases associated with the SARS-CoV-2 variant that first emerged recently in South Africa. These are the first two cases of this variant in the United States.

Viruses are constantly changing, leading to the emergence of variants. Variants are closely monitored for their ability to spread faster or cause more disease. South Carolina public health officials were notified late yesterday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of a South Carolina sample that was tested at LabCorp and determined to be the B.1.351 variant originally identified in South Africa. Also, DHEC's Public Health Laboratory tested samples on Jan. 25 and yesterday identified a separate case of the same variant. Since June 2020, DHEC's Public Health Laboratory has been performing tests of random samples in order to identify any instances of the variant viruses. DHEC’s Public Health Laboratory will continue to conduct this important sampling to identify any other changes in the virus.

Experts agree that existing vaccines work to protect us from this variant, even if we don’t know precisely how effective they are. At this time, there’s no evidence to suggest that the B.1.351 variant causes more severe illness.

“The arrival of the SARS-CoV-2 variant in our state is an important reminder to all South Carolinians that the fight against this deadly virus is far from over,” said Dr. Brannon Traxler, DHEC Interim Public Health Director. “While more COVID-19 vaccines are on the way, supplies are still limited. Every one of us must recommit to the fight by recognizing that we are all on the front lines now. We are all in this together.”

At this point in time, there is no known travel history and no connection between these two cases. Both are adults; one from the Lowcountry and one from the Pee Dee region. To protect their privacy, no further information will be released.

The B.1.351 variant has been identified in more than 30 countries but these are the first cases of this variant identified in the United States. Other states have had cases of another, called B.1.1.7, originally identified in United Kingdom. Both variants originally detected in the United Kingdom and South Africa spread easier and quicker than the majority of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The South Africa and United Kingdom variants emerged independently from each other and have different characteristics. Most variants do not change how the virus behaves and many disappear.

“We know that viruses mutate to live and live to mutate,” Dr. Traxler said. “That’s why it’s critical that we all continue to do our part by taking small actions that make a big difference. These include wearing our masks, staying at least six feet apart from others, avoiding large crowds, washing our hands, getting tested often, and when we can, getting vaccinated. These are the best tools for preventing the spread of the virus, no matter the strain.”

DHEC, in coordination with the CDC, will continue to watch out for COVID-19 variants. Public health officials will provide more information as it becomes available.

Safe and effective vaccines and following public health guidance are how to win the fight against COVID-19. For more information about the COVID-19 vaccine go to scdhec.gov/vaxfacts. For the latest information about COVID-19, go to scdhec.gov/COVID19.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A new variant of the coronavirus emerged Thursday in the United States, posing yet another public health challenge in a country already losing more than 3,000 people to COVID-19 every day.

The mutated version of the virus, first identified in South Africa, was found in two cases in South Carolina. Public health officials said it’s almost certain that there are more infections that have not been identified yet. They are also concerned that this version spreads more easily and that vaccines could be less effective against it.

The two cases were discovered in adults in different regions of the state and do not appear to be connected. Neither of the people infected has traveled recently, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control said Thursday.

“That’s frightening,” because it means there could be more undetected cases within the state, said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious diseases physician at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. “It’s probably more widespread.”

The arrival of the variant shows that “the fight against this deadly virus is far from over,” Dr. Brannon Traxler, South Carolina’s interim public health director, said in a statement. “While more COVID-19 vaccines are on the way, supplies are still limited. Every one of us must recommit to the fight by recognizing that we are all on the front lines now. We are all in this together.”

Viruses constantly mutate, and coronavirus variants are circulating around the globe, but scientists are primarily concerned with the emergence of three that researchers believe may spread more easily. Other variants first reported in the United Kingdom and Brazil were previously confirmed in the U.S.

As the variants bring a potential for greater infection risks in the U.S., pandemic-weary lawmakers in several states are pushing back against mask mandates , business closures and other protective restrictions ordered by governors.

States including Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Maryland, Kentucky and Indiana are weighing proposals to limit their governors’ abilities to impose emergency restrictions. Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled Assembly had been expected to vote to repeal Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ mask mandate, but lawmakers abruptly called off the vote Thursday in the face of broad criticism and out of concern it would jeopardize more than $49 million in federal aid. Pennsylvania lawmakers are considering a constitutional amendment to strip the governor of many of his emergency powers.

Governors argue that they need authority to act swiftly in a crisis, and limitations could slow critical emergency responses.

Meanwhile, Nebraska health officials said the state could be days away from lifting restrictions on indoor gatherings, citing a low percentage of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Other states seeing declining infections are also loosening limitations on restaurants and other businesses , though experts have warned the public to stay vigilant about masks and social distancing or risk further surges.

In South Carolina, the state health agency said the variant was found in one person from the state’s coastal region and another in its northeastern corner. The state gave little other information, citing privacy concerns, though Traxler said neither of the people was contagious any longer.

“Both were tested very early in the month, and my understanding is that both are doing well,” Traxler said.

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, loosened most of the state’s remaining pandemic restrictions in the fall. Spokesman Brian Symmes said McMaster does not plan to order new restrictions based on the discovery of the variant.

“This is important information for South Carolinians to have,” McMaster said in a tweet, “but it isn’t a reason for panic.”

Scientists last week reported preliminary signs that some of the recent mutations may modestly curb the effectiveness of two vaccines, although they stressed that the shots still protect against the disease. There are also signs that some of the new mutations may undermine tests for the virus and reduce the effectiveness of certain treatments.

The coronavirus has already sickened millions and killed roughly 430,000 people in the United States.

While the rollout of vaccines has been slow, President Joe Biden has pledged to deliver 100 million injections in his first 100 days in office — and suggested it’s possible the U.S. could reach 1.5 million shots a day.

While some European countries do extensive genetic testing to detect these variants, the U.S. has done little of this detective work. But scientists have been been quickly trying to do more, which has revealed the more contagious variants.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported at least 315 cases of the U.K.-discovered variant in the United States. Those reports have come from at least 28 states, and health officials believe it could become the dominant strain in the U.S. by March. That variant has been reported in at least 70 countries.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

The first U.S. case of the variant found in Brazil was announced earlier this week by health officials in Minnesota. It was a person who recently traveled to that South American nation. That version of the virus has popped up in more than a half-dozen countries.

The variant first found in South Africa was detected in October. Since then, it has been found in at least 30 other countries.

Some tests suggest the South African and Brazilian variants may be less susceptible to antibody drugs or antibody-rich blood from COVID-19 survivors, both of which help people fight off the virus.

Health officials also worry that if the virus changes enough, people might get COVID-19 a second time.

Biden on Monday reinstated COVID-19 travel restrictions on most non-U.S. travelers from Brazil, the U.K. and South Africa. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans avoid travel.

"The Minnesota Department of Health announced on Monday it has recorded the first known case in the U.S. of the highly transmissible COVID-19 variant that has been spreading through Brazil.

Known as the P.1 variant, it was detected amid a surge of cases in Manaus, Brazil. Minnesota health officials said the patient is a resident of the Twin Cities area who recently traveled to Brazil, and the strain was found via genomic sequencing of random blood samples. The person was tested on Jan. 9, and is now in isolation. Ruth Lynfield, Minnesota's state epidemiologist, said this is a reminder why ""it is so important to limit travel during a pandemic as much as possible.""

Scientists are closely studying three COVID-19 variants: P. 1, as well as B.1.1.7, first detected in the United Kingdom, and B1.351, first identified in South Africa. Virologists said the variants are independent of one another but there is some overlap in the mutations. The U.K. variant is spreading now in the U.S., but the South Africa variant has not yet been detected. Virologists are especially concerned that the Brazil and South Africa variants contain mutations that may evade the protections of some antibodies.

William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, told The Washington Post on Monday the Brazil variant is ""probably the one causing the most concern among people watching this. It is fair to say that P.1 is the object of very, very serious attention and concern among epidemiologists. We don't know why it has been so successful in Manaus."" Catherine Garcia"	-15.18
"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)

LONDON (AP) — Facebook’s quasi-independent oversight board issued its first rulings on Thursday, overturning four out of five decisions by the social network to take down questionable content.

But critics called the announcement largely irrelevant given the flood of misinformation, extremism and racism that remains on Facebook despite the company’s efforts over the past years.

“The whole thing is kind of like putting new windows on a house in which the roof has caved in,” said Gautam Hans, a Vanderbilt University expert on civil liberties and intellectual property. “The (oversight board) can’t do very much — it selects a tiny percentage of potential cases — to fix a company with so many systemic and in my opinion unfixable problems.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Nonetheless, Hans said he respects the effort and believes “there are some clear distinctions” between what the oversight board thinks the standards should be and what the company does.

The social media giant set up the oversight panel to rule on thorny issues about content on its platforms, in response to furious criticism about its inability to respond swiftly and effectively to misinformation, hate speech and nefarious influence campaigns.

Facebook regularly takes down thousands of posts and accounts, and about 150,000 of those cases have appealed to the oversight board since it launched in October. The board is prioritizing the review of cases that have the potential to affect many users around the world.

In its initial batch of rulings , the board ordered Facebook to restore posts by users that the company said broke standards on adult nudity, hate speech, or dangerous individuals.

One case, in which a Brazilian user’s Instagram post about breast cancer was automatically removed because it included images of female nipples, should have been allowed because the platform makes an exception for breast cancer awareness, the board said.

A Myanmar user’s Burmese-language Facebook post about Muslims that included two widely shared photos of a dead Syrian toddler was offensive but did not rise to the level of hate speech, it ruled.

The human rights group Muslim Advocates lambasted the decision, saying the board “bent over backwards to excuse hate in Myanmar — a county where Facebook has been complicit in a genocide against Muslims.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“It is clear that the Oversight Board is here to launder responsibility for (Facebook CEO Mark) Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg,” said Eric Naing, spokesperson for Muslim Advocates. “Instead of taking meaningful action to curb dangerous hate speech on the platform, Facebook punted responsibility to a third party board that used laughable technicalities to protect anti-Muslim hate content that contributes to genocide.”

Facebook admitted in 2018 that it did not do enough to prevent its platform from being used to incite violence in Myanmar.

In addition, a post with a quote falsely attributed to Joseph Goebbels , the Nazi propaganda minister, was cleared after the user told the board the intent was to compare the sentiment in the quote with Donald Trump’s presidency.

The board said a fourth post in French about COVID-19 that had been taken down because it breached standards on misinformation should be restored, saying it didn’t pose imminent harm. Among other things, the post called hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin a “harmless drug” that is being used to “save lives.” Claims that hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating the coronavirus have been widely debunked by top health officials after several studies found it ineffective in serious cases of COVID-19.

The decisions are binding, meaning CEO Mark Zuckerberg can’t do anything to change them.

The board agreed only with Facebook’s decision to take down a post with a slur used to describe Azerbaijanis , stemming from last year’s conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.

Still to come is the panel’s most high profile case - the decision to indefinitely suspend former President Donald Trump’s account. It will be the biggest test yet for the panel, which faces criticism that Facebook set it up primarily to stave off regulation or even an eventual breakup of the company as it faces antitrust scrutiny.

Co-chair Michael McConnell said the panel had started working on the Trump case but was only at an “extremely early stage.”

Full Coverage: Technology

“All this has happened extremely recently so they’re at the very beginning of their work,” he told an online press briefing.

The oversight board will start accepting public comments on the Trump case on Friday.

Facebook took down Trump’s account after he encouraged his supporters to not accept the election result and they stormed the U.S. Capitol in a deadly assault on Jan. 6. But the company referred the matter to the oversight board for what it called an “independent judgment” on upholding the decision.

"Today, the Oversight Board is announcing its first decisions.

In the five case decisions published today, the Board overturned four of Facebook’s decisions, upheld one and issued nine policy recommendations to the company. The cases covered four continents: Asia, Europe, North America and South America.

None of these cases had easy answers and deliberations revealed the enormous complexity of the issues involved.

In one case, Board Members looked at whether, in the context of an armed conflict, Facebook was right to remove an otherwise-permissible post because it contained a hateful slur. In another, they examined whether a post accused of spreading COVID-19 misinformation contributed to imminent harm. In several cases, Members questioned whether Facebook’s rules were clear enough for users to understand.

These decisions followed a process which was thorough, principled and globally relevant, as outlined in the Board’s Rulebook. The Board’s decisions are binding on Facebook and provide a critical independent check on how the company moderates content.

The outcome of the Board’s decisions The outcome of the Board’s decisions

After careful deliberation, the Board has:

Overturned Facebook’s decision on case 2020-002-FB-UA to remove a post under its Community Standard on Hate Speech. The post commented on the supposed lack of reaction to the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China, compared to the violent reaction to cartoons in France. Click here for more information.

Upheld Facebook’s decision on case 2020-003-FB-UA to remove a post under its Community Standard on Hate Speech. The post used the Russian word “тазики” (“taziks”) to describe Azerbaijanis, who the user claimed have no history compared to Armenians. Click here for more information.

Overturned Facebook’s original decision on case 2020-004-IG-UA to remove a post under its Community Standard on Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity. The post included photos of breast cancer symptoms which, in some cases, showed uncovered female nipples. Click here for more information.

Overturned Facebook’s decision on case 2020-005-FB-UA to remove a post under its Community Standard on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations. The post included an alleged quote from Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany. Click here for more information.

Overturned Facebook’s decision on case 2020-006-FB-FBR to remove a post under its Community Standard on Violence and Incitement. The post criticized the lack of a health strategy in France and included claims that a cure for COVID-19 exists. Click here for more information.

We have published the full decisions on the Board’s website.

How the Board made these decisions How the Board made these decisions

Since we started accepting cases in October 2020, more than 150,000 cases have been appealed to the Board. As we cannot hear every appeal, we are prioritising cases that have the potential to affect lots of users around the world, are of critical importance to public discourse or raise important questions about Facebook’s policies. Each case is assigned to a five-Member panel, which included at least one Member from the region implicated in the content and a mix of gender representation.

For each case, Members decided whether the content violated Facebook’s Community Standards and values. They also considered whether Facebook’s removal of the content respected international human rights standards, including on freedom of expression and other human rights. Members considered factors ranging from the nuances of language, to the user’s intent and the context in which the content was posted.

Members from different countries brought a range of experiences to deliberations. Expertise in areas such as journalism, technology, and human rights deepened their analysis, while differing views ensured a robust debate considering many angles.

After each panel reached a decision, its findings were reviewed and approved by a majority of the Board. This is required for a decision to be issued.

Holding Facebook to account Holding Facebook to account

Today’s decisions are binding on Facebook and we will hold the company accountable for implementing them.

Facebook now has seven days to restore content in line with the Board’s decisions. The company will also examine whether identical content with parallel context associated with the Board’s decisions should remain on its platform. In addition, Facebook must publicly respond to any policy recommendations the Board has made in its decisions within 30 days.

Public comments Public comments

Today, alongside our first decisions, we are also publishing nearly 80 public comments.

These provided valuable insights in areas such as local context and Facebook’s Community Standards, as well as giving feedback on the public comments process itself. They shaped the Board’s thinking and, in one case, a policy recommendation drew upon public comments.

As with all the Board’s early work, we will iterate and improve our public comments process as we receive feedback. In particular, we are considering how to provide more context in our case descriptions and give third parties more time to comment. We encourage people and organizations to register for updates on new cases and contribute to future calls for public comment.

What’s next What’s next

The Board’s first case decisions are another step towards building a strong institution capable of holding Facebook to account over the long-term.

In the coming days we expect to publish a decision on case 2020-007-FB-FBR. This case relates to India and a post removed under Facebook’s Violence and Incitement Community Standard. We will also shortly be announcing the Board’s next set of cases, and opening public comment on the case accepted by the Board last week relating to former US President Trump’s indefinite suspension from Facebook and Instagram.

Recent events in the United States and around the world have highlighted the enormous impact that content decisions taken by internet services have on human rights and free expression. The challenges and limitations of the existing approaches to moderating content draw attention to the value of independent oversight of the most consequential decisions by companies such as Facebook.

We believe the first case decisions by the Oversight Board demonstrate our commitment to holding Facebook to account, by standing up for the interests of users and communities around the world, and by beginning to reshape Facebook’s approach to content moderation. This is the start of a process that will take time, and we look forward to sharing our progress through the Board’s many subsequent case decisions."	-15.18
"The Oversight Board has overturned Facebook’s decision to remove a post under its Hate Speech Community Standard. The Board found that, while the post might be considered offensive, it did not reach the level of hate speech.

About the case

On October 29, 2020, a user in Myanmar posted in a Facebook group in Burmese. The post included two widely shared photographs of a Syrian toddler of Kurdish ethnicity who drowned attempting to reach Europe in September 2015.

The accompanying text stated that there is something wrong with Muslims (or Muslim men) psychologically or with their mindset. It questioned the lack of response by Muslims generally to the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China, compared to killings in response to cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad in France. The post concludes that recent events in France reduce the user’s sympathies for the depicted child, and seems to imply the child may have grown up to be an extremist.

Facebook removed this content under its Hate Speech Community Standard.

Key findings

Facebook removed this content as it contained the phrase “[there is] something wrong with Muslims psychologically.” As its Hate Speech Community Standard prohibits generalized statements of inferiority about the mental deficiencies of a group on the basis of their religion, the company removed the post.

The Board considered that while the first part of the post, taken on its own, might appear to make an insulting generalization about Muslims (or Muslim men), the post should be read as a whole, considering context.

While Facebook translated the text as: “[i]t’s indeed something’s wrong with Muslims psychologically,” the Board’s translators suggested: “[t]hose male Muslims have something wrong in their mindset.” They also suggested that the terms used were not derogatory or violent.

The Board’s context experts noted that, while hate speech against Muslim minority groups is common and sometimes severe in Myanmar, statements referring to Muslims as mentally unwell or psychologically unstable are not a strong part of this rhetoric.

Taken in context, the Board believes that the text is better understood as a commentary on the apparent inconsistency between Muslims’ reactions to events in France and in China. That expression of opinion is protected under Facebook’s Community Standards and does not reach the level of hate speech.

Considering international human rights standards on limiting freedom of expression, the Board found that, while the post might be considered pejorative or offensive towards Muslims, it did not advocate hatred or intentionally incite any form of imminent harm. As such, the Board does not consider its removal to be necessary to protect the rights of others.

The Board also stressed that Facebook’s sensitivity to anti-Muslim hate speech was understandable, particularly given the history of violence and discrimination against Muslims in Myanmar and the increased risk ahead of the country’s general election in November 2020. However, for this specific post, the Board concludes that Facebook was incorrect to remove the content.

The Oversight Board’s decision

The Oversight Board overturns Facebook’s decision to remove the content and requires that the post be restored.

Facebook’s automated systems originally removed the post for violating the company’s Community Standard on Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity.

In October 2020, a user in Brazil posted a picture to Instagram with a title in Portuguese indicating that it was to raise awareness of signs of breast cancer. The image was pink, in line with “Pink October,” an international campaign to raise awareness of this disease. Eight photographs within the picture showed breast cancer symptoms with corresponding descriptions. Five of them included visible and uncovered female nipples, while the remaining three photographs included female breasts, with the nipples either out of shot or covered by a hand. The post was removed by an automated system enforcing Facebook’s Community Standard on Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity. After the Board selected the case, Facebook determined this was an error and restored the post.

Key findings

In its response, Facebook claimed that the Board should decline to hear this case. The company argued that, having restored the post, there was no longer disagreement between the user and Facebook that the content should stay up, making this case moot.

The Board rejects Facebook’s argument. The need for disagreement applies only at the moment the user exhausts Facebook’s internal appeal process. As the user and Facebook disagreed at that time, the Board can hear the case.

Facebook’s decision to restore the content also does not make this case moot, as the company claims. On top of making binding decisions on whether to restore pieces of content, the Board also offers users a full explanation for why their post was removed.

The incorrect removal of this post indicates the lack of proper human oversight which raises human rights concerns. The detection and removal of this post was entirely automated. Facebook’s automated systems failed to recognize the words “Breast Cancer,” which appeared on the image in Portuguese, and the post was removed in error. As Facebook’s rules treat male and female nipples differently, using inaccurate automation to enforce these rules disproportionately affects women’s freedom of expression. Enforcement which relies solely on automation without adequate human oversight also interferes with freedom of expression.

In this case, the user was told that the post violated Instagram’s Community Guidelines, implying that sharing photos of uncovered female nipples to raise breast cancer awareness is not allowed. However, Facebook’s Community Standard on Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity, expressly allows nudity when the user seeks to “raise awareness about a cause or educational or medical reasons” and specifically permits uncovered female nipples to advance “breast cancer awareness.” As Facebook’s Community Standards apply to Instagram, the user’s post is covered by the exception above. Hence, Facebook’s removal of the content was inconsistent with its Community Standards.

The Oversight Board’s decision

The Oversight Board overturns Facebook’s original decision to remove the content and requires that the post be restored. The Board notes that Facebook has already taken action to this effect.

The Board recommends that Facebook:

Inform users when automated enforcement is used to moderate their content, ensure that users can appeal automated decisions to a human being in certain cases, and improve automated detection of images with text-overlay so that posts raising awareness of breast cancer symptoms are not wrongly flagged for review. Facebook should also improve its transparency reporting on its use of automated enforcement.

Revise Instagram’s Community Guidelines to specify that female nipples can be shown to raise breast cancer awareness and clarify that where there are inconsistencies between Instagram’s Community Guidelines and Facebook’s Community Standards, the latter take precedence.

"The Oversight Board has overturned Facebook’s decision to remove a post which the company claims violated its Community Standard on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations. The Board found that these rules were not made sufficiently clear to users.

About the case

In October 2020, a user posted a quote which was incorrectly attributed to Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany. The quote, in English, claimed that, rather than appealing to intellectuals, arguments should appeal to emotions and instincts. It stated that truth does not matter and is subordinate to tactics and psychology. There were no pictures of Joseph Goebbels or Nazi symbols in the post. In their statement to the Board, the user said that their intent was to draw a comparison between the sentiment in the quote and the presidency of Donald Trump.

The user first posted the content two years earlier and was prompted to share it again by Facebook’s “memory” function, which allows users to see what they posted on a specific day in a previous year, with the option of resharing the post.

Facebook removed the post for violating its Community Standard on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations.

Key findings

In its response to the Board, Facebook confirmed that Joseph Goebbels is on the company’s list of dangerous individuals. Facebook claimed that posts which share a quote attributed to a dangerous individual are treated as expressing support for them, unless the user provides additional context to make their intent explicit. Facebook removed the post because the user did not make clear that they shared the quote to condemn Joseph Goebbels, to counter extremism or hate speech, or for academic or news purposes.

Reviewing the case, the Board found that the quote did not support the Nazi party’s ideology or the regime’s acts of hate and violence. Comments on the post from the user’s friends supported the user’s claim that they sought to compare the presidency of Donald Trump to the Nazi regime.

Under international human rights standards, any rules which restrict freedom of expression must be clear, precise and publicly accessible, so that individuals can conduct themselves accordingly. The Board does not believe that Facebook’s rules on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations met this requirement.

The Board noted a gap between the rules made public through Facebook’s Community Standards and additional, non-public rules used by the company’s content moderators. In its publicly available rules, Facebook is not sufficiently clear that, when posting a quote attributed to a dangerous individual, the user must make clear that they are not praising or supporting them.

Facebook’s policy on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations also does not provide clear examples that explain the meaning of terms such as “praise” and “support,” making it difficult for users to understand this Community Standard. While Facebook confirmed to the Board that Joseph Goebbels is designated as a dangerous individual, the company does not provide a public list of dangerous individuals and organizations, or examples of these. The Board also notes that, in this case, the user does not seem to have been told which Community Standard their content violated.

The Oversight Board’s decision

The Oversight Board overturns Facebook’s decision to remove the content and requires that the post be restored.

In a policy advisory statement, the Board recommends that Facebook:

Ensure that users are always notified of the reasons for any enforcement of the Community Standards against them, including the specific rule Facebook is enforcing.

Explain and provide examples of the application of key terms from the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy, including the meanings of “praise,” “support” and “representation.” The Community Standard should also better advise users on how to make their intent clear when discussing dangerous individuals or organizations.

Provide a public list of the organizations and individuals designated as ‘dangerous’ under the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations Community Standard or, at the very least, a list of examples.

"The Oversight Board has overturned Facebook’s decision to remove a post which it claimed, “contributes to the risk of imminent… physical harm.” The Board found Facebook’s misinformation and imminent harm rule (part of its Violence and Incitement Community Standard) to be inappropriately vague and recommended, among other things, that the company create a new Community Standard on health misinformation.

About the case

In October 2020, a user posted a video and accompanying text in French in a public Facebook group related to COVID-19. The post alleged a scandal at the Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament (the French agency responsible for regulating health products), which refused to authorize hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin for use against COVID-19, but authorized and promoted remdesivir. The user criticized the lack of a health strategy in France and stated that “[Didier] Raoult’s cure” is being used elsewhere to save lives. The user’s post also questioned what society had to lose by allowing doctors to prescribe in an emergency a “harmless drug” when the first symptoms of COVID-19 appear.

In its referral to the Board, Facebook cited this case as an example of the challenges of addressing the risk of offline harm that can be caused by misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key findings

Facebook removed the content for violating its misinformation and imminent harm rule, which is part of its Violence and Incitement Community Standard, finding the post contributed to the risk of imminent physical harm during a global pandemic. Facebook explained that it removed the post as it contained claims that a cure for COVID-19 exists. The company concluded that this could lead people to ignore health guidance or attempt to self-medicate.

The Board observed that, in this post, the user was opposing a governmental policy and aimed to change that policy. The combination of medicines that the post claims constitute a cure are not available without a prescription in France and the content does not encourage people to buy or take drugs without a prescription. Considering these and other contextual factors, the Board noted that Facebook had not demonstrated the post would rise to the level of imminent harm, as required by its own rule in the Community Standards.

The Board also found that Facebook’s decision did not comply with international human rights standards on limiting freedom of expression. Given that Facebook has a range of tools to deal with misinformation, such as providing users with additional context, the company failed to demonstrate why it did not choose a less intrusive option than removing the content.

The Board also found Facebook’s misinformation and imminent harm rule, which this post is said to have violated, to be inappropriately vague and inconsistent with international human rights standards. A patchwork of policies found on different parts of Facebook’s website make it difficult for users to understand what content is prohibited. Changes to Facebook’s COVID-19 policies announced in the company’s Newsroom have not always been reflected in its Community Standards, while some of these changes even appear to contradict them.

The Oversight Board’s decision

The Oversight Board overturns Facebook’s decision to remove the content and requires that the post be restored.

In a policy advisory statement, the Board recommends that Facebook:

Create a new Community Standard on health misinformation, consolidating and clarifying the existing rules in one place. This should define key terms such as “misinformation.”

Adopt less intrusive means of enforcing its health misinformation policies where the content does not reach Facebook’s threshold of imminent physical harm.

Increase transparency around how it moderates health misinformation, including publishing a transparency report on how the Community Standards have been enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This recommendation draws upon the public comments the Board received.

"The Oversight Board has upheld Facebook’s decision to remove a post containing a demeaning slur which violated Facebook’s Community Standard on Hate Speech.

About the case

In November 2020, a user posted content which included historical photos described as showing churches in Baku, Azerbaijan. The accompanying text in Russian claimed that Armenians built Baku and that this heritage, including the churches, has been destroyed. The user used the term “тазики” (“taziks”) to describe Azerbaijanis, who the user claimed are nomads and have no history compared to Armenians.

The user included hashtags in the post calling for an end to Azerbaijani aggression and vandalism. Another hashtag called for the recognition of Artsakh, the Armenian name for the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is at the center of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The post received more than 45,000 views and was posted during the recent armed conflict between the two countries.

Key findings

Facebook removed the post for violating its Community Standard on Hate Speech, claiming the post used a slur to describe a group of people based on a protected characteristic (national origin).

The post used the term ""тазики"" (“taziks”) to describe Azerbaijanis. While this can be translated literally from Russian as “wash bowl,” it can also be understood as wordplay on the Russian word “азики” (“aziks”), a derogatory term for Azerbaijanis which features on Facebook’s internal list of slur terms. Independent linguistic analysis commissioned on behalf of the Board confirms Facebook’s understanding of ""тазики"" as a dehumanizing slur attacking national origin.

The context in which the term was used makes clear it was meant to dehumanize its target. As such, the Board believes that the post violated Facebook’s Community Standards.

The Board also found that Facebook’s decision to remove the content complied with the company’s values. While Facebook takes “Voice” as a paramount value, the company’s values also include “Safety” and “Dignity.”

From September to November 2020, fighting over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh resulted in the deaths of several thousand people, with the content in question being posted shortly before a ceasefire.

In light of the dehumanizing nature of the slur and the danger that such slurs can escalate into physical violence, Facebook was permitted in this instance to prioritize people's ""Safety"" and ""Dignity"" over the user's ""Voice.""

A majority of the Board found that the removal of this post was consistent with international human rights standards on limiting freedom of expression.

The Board believed it is apparent to users that using the term “тазики” to describe Azerbaijanis would be classed as a dehumanizing label for a group belonging to a certain nationality, and that Facebook had a legitimate aim in removing the post.

The majority of the Board also viewed Facebook’s removal of the post as necessary and proportionate to protect the rights of others. Dehumanizing slurs can create an environment of discrimination and violence which can silence other users. During an armed conflict, the risks to people’s rights to equality, security of person and, potentially, life are especially pronounced.

While the majority of the Board found that these risks made Facebook’s response proportionate, a minority believed that Facebook’s action did not meet international standards and was not proportionate. A minority thought Facebook should have considered other enforcement measures besides removal.

The Oversight Board’s decision

The Board upholds Facebook’s decision to remove the content.

In a policy advisory statement, the Board recommends that Facebook:

Ensure that users are always notified of the reasons for any enforcement of the Community Standards against them, including the specific rule Facebook is enforcing. In this case, the user was informed that the post violated Facebook’s Community Standard on Hate Speech but was not told that this was because the post contained a slur attacking national origin. Facebook’s lack of transparency left its decision open to the mistaken belief that the company removed the content because the user expressed a view it disagreed with.

"Facebook's oversight board has taken on a major case, as it's set to review the company's decision to boot the president of the United States from its platform.

Facebook announced Thursday it has referred its decision to indefinitely suspend former President Donald Trump's account to the Facebook independent Oversight Board, which has accepted the case.

""We believe our decision was necessary and right,"" Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, said. ""Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld. While we await the board's decision, Mr. Trump's access will remain suspended indefinitely.""

Facebook suspended Trump's account in the wake of the deadly riot at the Capitol building by his supporters, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying the ""risks of allowing the president to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great"" as he attempted to ""undermine the peaceful and lawful transfer of power."" Facebook said the suspension would continue ""indefinitely"" and ""at least"" until he was out of office.

The oversight board pledged to offer a ""thorough and independent assessment"" of the case and provide ""policy recommendations from the board on suspensions when the user is a political leader."" Facebook noted that whatever decision the board reaches will be binding and can't be overruled by the company's executives. A decision will come within 90 days.

Twitter also took action against Trump over the Capitol riot by permanently banning his account. But NBC News' Dylan Byers notes that referring the case to the oversight board allows Facebook to ""outsource"" this final decision. Brendan Morrow"	-15.18
"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18

"“This is now more than a nursing home scandal,” said Representative Elise Stefanik, a conservative Republican from upstate New York. “This is a massive corruption and cover-up scandal.”

Deaths in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have accounted for about a third of the nation’s some 430,000 Covid-19 deaths. Federal and state authorities have made vaccinating staff and residents at such facilities a top priority, though that effort has been slower than hoped.

But even as state officials in New York tackle vaccine shortages, the count of deaths in the state’s nursing homes remained a source of controversy. Mr. Cuomo had been accused of obscuring a more accurate estimate of nursing home deaths, because the state’s count only included the number of deaths at the facilities, rather than accounting for the residents who died at a hospital after being transferred there.

For its report, Ms. James’s office surveyed dozens of homes and found consistent discrepancies between deaths reported to the attorney general’s investigators and those reported to and officially released by the Health Department.

In one instance, an unnamed facility reported to the Health Department that it had 11 confirmed and presumed deaths on site through early August. The attorney general’s survey of that same facility, however, found 40 deaths, including 27 at the home and 13 in hospitals.

Another facility reported one confirmed and six presumed Covid-19 deaths to the Health Department, according to the report. The attorney general’s office, however, said the facility reported to its investigators that there were more than four times that number — 31 dead — by mid-April.

The attorney general’s report also scrutinized immunity provisions granted to health care providers codified by Mr. Cuomo in the state budget. The report said the protection of immunity may have prompted some nursing homes to make financially motivated decisions at the height of the pandemic, like admitting patients even when the facilities were facing staff shortages or were unequipped to care for them."	-15.18
"Investigations Reveal DOH Publicly Reported Data Undercounted COVID-19 Deaths

and Many Nursing Homes Failed to Comply with Critical Infection Control Policies

AG Conducting Ongoing Investigations into More Than 20 Facilities

NEW YORK – Attorney General Letitia James today released a report on her office’s ongoing investigations into nursing homes’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March, Attorney General James has been investigating nursing homes throughout New York state based on allegations of patient neglect and other concerning conduct that may have jeopardized the health and safety of residents and employees.

Among those findings were that a larger number of nursing home residents died from COVID-19 than the New York State Department of Health’s (DOH) published nursing home data reflected and may have been undercounted by as much as 50 percent. The investigations also revealed that nursing homes’ lack of compliance with infection control protocols put residents at increased risk of harm, and facilities that had lower pre-pandemic staffing ratings had higher COVID-19 fatality rates. Based on these findings and subsequent investigation, Attorney General James is conducting ongoing investigations into more than 20 nursing homes whose reported conduct during the first wave of the pandemic presented particular concern.

“As the pandemic and our investigations continue, it is imperative that we understand why the residents of nursing homes in New York unnecessarily suffered at such an alarming rate,” said Attorney General James. “While we cannot bring back the individuals we lost to this crisis, this report seeks to offer transparency that the public deserves and to spur increased action to protect our most vulnerable residents. Nursing homes residents and workers deserve to live and work in safe environments, and I will continue to work hard to safeguard this basic right during this precarious time.”

Background

The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) is the only law enforcement agency in the state specifically mandated to investigate and prosecute abuse and neglect of residents in nursing homes. In early March, OAG received and began to investigate allegations and indications of COVID-19-related neglect of residents in nursing homes. At the direction of Governor Andrew Cuomo, on April 23, OAG set up a hotline to receive complaints relating to communications by nursing homes with family members prohibited from in-person visits to nursing homes and formally initiated a large-scale investigation of nursing homes’ responses to the pandemic. OAG received more than 770 complaints on the hotline through August 3, and an additional 179 complaints through November 16. OAG also continued to receive allegations of COVID-19-related neglect of residents through pre-existing reporting systems.

Overview of Findings

The report includes preliminary findings based on data obtained in investigations conducted to date, recommendations that are based on those findings, related findings in pre-pandemic investigations of nursing homes, and other available data and analysis. Based on this information and subsequent investigation, OAG is currently conducting investigations into more than 20 nursing homes across the state. OAG found that:

A larger number of nursing home residents died from COVID-19 than DOH data reflected;

Lack of compliance with infection control protocols put residents at increased risk of harm;

Nursing homes that entered the pandemic with low U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) Staffing ratings had higher COVID-19 fatality rates;

Insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for nursing home staff put residents at increased risk of harm;

Insufficient COVID-19 testing for residents and staff in the early stages of the pandemic put residents at increased risk of harm;

The current state reimbursement model for nursing homes gives a financial incentive to owners of for-profit nursing homes to transfer funds to related parties (ultimately increasing their own profit) instead of investing in higher levels of staffing and PPE;

Lack of nursing home compliance with the executive order requiring communication with family members caused avoidable pain and distress; and

Government guidance requiring the admission of COVID-19 patients into nursing homes may have put residents at increased risk of harm in some facilities and may have obscured the data available to assess that risk.

Undercounting of COVID-19 Deaths in Nursing Homes

Preliminary data obtained by OAG suggests that many nursing home residents died from COVID-19 in hospitals after being transferred from their nursing homes, which is not reflected in DOH’s published total nursing home death data. Preliminary data also reflects apparent underreporting to DOH by some nursing homes of resident deaths occurring in nursing homes. In fact, the OAG found that nursing home resident deaths appear to be undercounted by DOH by approximately 50 percent.

OAG asked 62 nursing homes (10 percent of the total facilities in New York) for information about on-site and in-hospital deaths from COVID-19. Using the data from these 62 nursing homes, OAG compared: (1) in-facility deaths reported to OAG compared to in-facility deaths publicized by DOH, and (2) total deaths reported to OAG compared to total deaths publicized by DOH.

In one example, a facility reported five confirmed and six presumed COVID-19 deaths at the facility as of August 3 to DOH. However, the facility reported to OAG a total of 27 COVID-19 deaths at the facility and 13 hospital deaths — a discrepancy of 29 deaths.

Lack of Compliance with Infection Control Policies

OAG received numerous complaints that some nursing homes failed to implement proper infection controls to prevent or mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 to vulnerable residents. Among those reports were allegations that several nursing homes around the state failed to plan and take proper infection control measures, including:

Failing to properly isolate residents who tested positive for COVID-19;

Failing to adequately screen or test employees for COVID-19;

Demanding that sick employees continue to work and care for residents or face retaliation or termination;

Failing to train employees in infection control protocols; and

Failing to obtain, fit, and train caregivers with PPE.

For instance, OAG received a complaint that at a for-profit nursing home located north of New York City, residents who tested positive for COVID-19 were intermingled with the general population for several months because the facility had not yet created a “COVID-19 only” unit. At another for-profit facility on Long Island, COVID-19 patients who were transferred to the facility after a hospital stay and were supposed to be placed in a separate COVID-19 unit in the nursing home were, in fact, scattered throughout the facility despite available beds in the COVID-19 unit. This situation was allegedly resolved only after someone at the facility learned of an impending DOH infection control visit scheduled for the next day, before which those residents were hurriedly transferred to the appropriate designated unit.

OAG received reports that nursing homes did not properly screen staff members before allowing them to enter the facility to work with residents. Among those reports, OAG received an allegation that a for-profit nursing home north of New York City failed to consistently conduct COVID-19 employee screening. It was reported that some staff avoided having their temperatures taken and answering a COVID-19 questionnaire at times when the screening station at the facility’s front entrance had no employees present to take that information or when staff entered the facility through a back entrance, avoiding the screening station altogether.

At yet another facility in Western New York, a nurse reported to OAG that immediately prior to the facility’s first DOH inspection in late April, a nurse supervisor had set up bins in front of the units with gowns and N95 masks to make it appear that the facility had an adequate supply of appropriate PPE for staff. The nurse alleged that the nurse supervisor came in to work unusually early the day of the first inspection and brought out all new PPE and collected all of the used gowns. Although the initial DOH survey conducted that day did not result in negative findings, DOH returned to the facility for follow-up inspections, issued the facility several citations, and ultimately placed the facility in “Immediate Jeopardy.”

Nursing Home with Low Staffing Ratings Had Higher Fatality Rates

There are 619 nursing homes in New York, and 401 of these facilities are for-profit, privately owned, and operated entities. Of the state’s 401 for-profit facilities, more than two-thirds — 280 nursing homes — have the lowest possible CMS Staffing ratings. The Staffing rating reflects the number of staffing hours in the nursing department of a facility relative to the number of residents. As of November 16, 3,487 COVID-19 resident deaths (over half of all deaths) occurred in these 280 facilities. Some of these facilities have also been known to transfer facility funds to owners and investors, rather than use them to invest in additional staffing to care for residents.

Pre-existing, insufficient staffing levels put residents and staff at increased risk of harm during the pandemic. As nursing home resident and staff COVID-19 infections rose during the initial wave of the pandemic, staffing absences increased at many nursing homes. As a result, already-low staffing levels decreased even further, to especially dangerous levels in some homes, even as the need for care increased due to the need to comply with COVID-19 infection control protocols and the loss of assistance from family visitors. OAG’s preliminary investigations reflect many examples where for-profit nursing homes’ pre-pandemic low staffing model simply snapped under the stress of the pandemic.

OAG received a complaint from a resident’s son about a for-profit nursing home in New York City alleging that his mother was not receiving proper care because of critically low staffing levels at the facility. His mother was never tested for COVID-19, but later died while exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. Between late March and early April, the facility was so understaffed due to staff quarantining, working from home, and pre-existing low staffing, that the onsite management of the entire facility was left in the hands of just two nurse supervisors. During the week of April 5, 33 residents died at that facility, 15 percent of all its residents.

In addition, preliminary investigations indicate that when there were insufficient staff to care for residents, some nursing homes pressured, knowingly permitted, or incentivized existing employees who were ill or met quarantine criteria to report to work and even work multiple consecutive shifts, in violation of infection control protocols. These policies put both residents and staff at great risk.

Immunity Provisions

Despite these disturbing and potentially unlawful findings, due to recent changes in state law, it remains unclear to what extent facilities or individuals can be held accountable if found to have failed to appropriately protect the residents in their care.

On March 23, Governor Cuomo created limited immunity provisions for health care providers relating to COVID-19. The Emergency Disaster Treatment Protection Act (EDTPA) provides immunity to health care professionals from potential liability arising from certain decisions, actions and/or omissions related to the care of individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is reasonable to provide some protections for health care workers making impossible health care decisions in good faith during an unprecedented public health crisis, it would not be appropriate or just for nursing homes owners to interpret this action as providing blanket immunity for causing harm to residents.

In order to ensure no one can evade potential accountability, Attorney General James recommends eliminating these newly enacted immunity provisions.

Attorney General James encourages anyone with information or concerns about nursing home conditions to file confidential complaints online or by calling 833-249-8499.

"One of the last major economic report cards of the Trump era lends perspective to the historic damage caused by the pandemic, which continued to weigh on growth in the final quarter of 2020.

By the numbers: The U.S. economy grew at a 4% annualized pace in the fourth quarter, a sharp slowdown in growth compared to the prior quarter. For the full year, the economy shrank by 3.5% — the first annual contraction since the financial crisis and the worst decline since 1946.

What happened: A resurgence in coronavirus cases and a delay in additional government aid contributed to the pullback in growth. In the third quarter, the U.S. economy grew at a 33.4% annualized pace.

In normal times, a 4% annualized growth rate would be strong. But in pandemic times, it shows the sharp bounce back expected once the economy reopened wasn't sustained.

What they're saying: The report ""represents a major disappointment and hit to the nascent recovery in the domestic economy,"" Joseph Brusuelas, an economist at RSM, wrote in a note.

Zoom in: Economic growth in the final quarter of the year was driven by strong consumer spending, capital expenditures (i.e. businesses investing in equipment, buildings, etc.) and the hot housing sector.

It was dragged down by a slump in state, local and federal government spending and a surge in imports (which are a curb on GDP).

The bottom line: The U.S. economy remains in a deep hole and a full economic recovery is a ways off. The economy is still over $473 billion smaller than it was before the pandemic hit."	-15.18
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted at its deepest pace since World War Two in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic depressed consumer spending and business investment, pushing millions of Americans out of work and into poverty.

Though a recovery is underway, momentum slowed significantly as the year wound down amid a resurgence in coronavirus infections and exhaustion of nearly $3 trillion in relief money from the government. The moderation is likely to persist at least through the first three months of 2021.

The economy’s prospects hinge on the distribution of vaccines to fight the virus. President Joe Biden has unveiled a recovery plan worth $1.9 trillion, but some lawmakers have balked at the price tag soon after the government provided nearly $900 billion in additional stimulus in late December.

White House economic advisor Brian Deese said the report from the Commerce Department on Thursday underscored the urgency for Congress to pass Biden’s plan, warning that the cost of doing nothing was too high.

“Without swift action, we risk a continued economic crisis that will make it harder for Americans to return to work and get back on their feet,” said Deese.

Gross domestic product decreased 3.5% in 2020, the biggest drop since 1946. That followed 2.2% growth in 2019 and was the first annual decline in GDP since the 2007-09 Great Recession.

(Graphic:U.S. GDP in 2020: The Big Shrink: )

Nearly every sector, with the exception of government and the housing market, contracted last year. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, plunged 3.9%, the worst performance since 1932. The economy tumbled into recession last February.

Delays by the government to offer another rescue package and renewed business disruptions caused by the virus restricted GDP growth to a 4.0% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The big step-back from a historic 33.4% growth pace in the third quarter left GDP 2.5% below its level at the end of 2019.

The economy is expected to return to its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter of this year.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and pledged to continue pumping money into the economy through bond purchases, noting that “the pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment has moderated in recent months.”

With the virus still raging, economists are expecting growth to slow to below a 2.0% rate in the first quarter, before regaining speed by summer as the additional stimulus kicks in and more Americans get vaccinated.

“We foresee record-breaking consumer spending growth in 2021 with households benefiting from a watered-down $1.2 trillion version of Biden’s rescue plan, vaccine diffusion gradually reaching two thirds of Americans by July and employment accelerating this spring,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Stocks on Wall Street rallied as mega-cap technology shares tried to recoup recent losses. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

K-SHAPED RECOVERY

Services businesses like restaurants, bars and hotels have borne the brunt of the recession, disproportionately impacting lower-wage earners, mostly women and minorities. That has led to a so-called K-shaped recovery, where better-paid workers are doing well while lower-paid workers are losing out.

The stars of the recovery have been the housing market and manufacturing as those who are still employed seek larger homes away from city centers, and buy electronics for home offices and schooling. A survey by professors at the University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame showed poverty increased by 2.4 percentage points to 11.8% in the second half of 2020. The sharpest rise since the 1960s boosted the ranks of the poor by 8.1 million people.

Rising poverty was highlighted by persistent labor market weakness. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 847,000 for the week ended Jan. 23. While that was down 67,000 from the prior week, claims remain well above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession.

(Graphic: Jobless claims: )

Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs 1.3 million people filed claims last week.

The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. Only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered. About 18.3 million Americans were receiving unemployment checks in early 2021.

“The labor market is struggling this winter, but better times are ahead,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Lack of jobs and the temporary expiration of a government weekly jobless subsidy curtailed growth in consumer spending to a 2.5% rate in the fourth quarter after a record 41% pace in the July-September quarter.

But business investment grew at a 13.8% rate, with spending on equipment rising at a 24.9% pace. Spending on nonresidential structures rebounded after four straight quarterly declines.

Businesses also accumulated inventories last quarter, contributing to GDP growth. But the inventory build pulled in more imports, leading to a larger trade deficit, which subtracted from output. The housing market recorded another quarter of double-digit growth, thanks to historically low mortgage rates. Government spending was weak."	-15.18

"AMC Networks is notably different than AMC Theatres. But there might be some confusion about that on Wall Street today.

Video game retailer GameStop's stock has been soaring lately thanks to day traders on the Reddit WallStreetBets forum. As The Wall Street Journal explains, ""ordinary investors, stuck at home in the pandemic,"" are ""buying things Wall Street has bet against,"" all while touting ""their long-shot wagers with the expression 'YOLO.''

And on Wednesday, AMC Theatres, the theater chain that has been narrowly avoiding bankruptcy over the past year as its industry is hit hard by the pandemic, saw its stock soar. Reddit users, The Verge writes, are ""turning their attention"" to AMC, ""creating memes and spamming AMC emoji in an effort to convince thousands of people to buy AMC stock."" The theater chain seemed to be the latest beneficiary of what Bloomberg dubbed the ""GameStop effect.""

But if you're inclined to buy AMC Theatres stock, make sure it's AMC Entertainment, not AMC Networks. After all, the latter is actually the company that owns the AMC cable channel, not the AMC theater chain. Yet analysts pointed out that both AMCs were having a good morning, maybe thanks to some confusion about this distinction.

Just guessing here, but I think AMC Networks - the cable programmer that brings you Better Call Saul - is spiking bc Redditors are confusing it with AMC Entertainment - the theater company they are trying to manipulate, which has no connection to the TV company. pic.twitter.com/BnoZK6c9ON — Peter Kafka (@pkafka) January 27, 2021

""For all of the retail investors out there saying they are so sophisticated, please explain why so many of them are confusing the stocks of AMC Theatres with AMC Networks,"" CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote.

At the same time, CNBC's Alex Sherman offered an alternate theory, writing, ""I actually think it's because [AMC Networks] is one of the most shorted companies — and they're all spiking."" Sherman added, ""It just so happens that two AMC entertainment companies are thought to have businesses in deep trouble!""

Either way, anyone who was confused has now learned the importance of knowing your AMCs. Brendan Morrow"	-15.18

"Some major brokerage houses have begun to respond to a frenetic surge in the price of shares of certain companies that has been attributed to rabid buying by individual investors inspired by social-media platforms.

On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade said it was restricting trading in GameStop GME, +46.80% and AMC Entertainment Holdings AMC, +44.26% , along with other names, amid a triple-digit percentage surge in the price of those companies in recent days.

“In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities,” a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, referring to the ticker symbols of the companies. “We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors.”

Charles Schwab, which bought TD Ameritrade but operates it as an independent retail brokerage, said that it has tightened margin requirements in some of those stocks, including GameStop.

A Schwab spokeswoman said that the platform changed its margin requirements, limiting how much an investor can borrow, on Jan. 13 and said it has placed “restrictions in place on certain transactions in GME and other securities.”

On Thursday, Interactive Brokers Group IBKR, -4.96% announced that as of midday Wednesday, it put GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry Limited BB, -1.98% , retailer Express Ltd. EXPR, +22.38% , and Koss Corp. KOSS, +82.77% option trading into liquidation only due to the extraordinary volatility in the markets. Meaning investors could only unwind their positions, not create new ones.

“In addition, long stock positions will require 100% margin and short stock positions will require 300% margin until further notice,” the brokerage said.

“We do not believe this situation will subside until the exchanges and regulators halt or put certain symbols into liquidation only. We will continue to monitor market conditions and may add or remove symbols as may be warranted.”

The restrictive moves come as shares of videogame retailer GameStock have shot up 1,600% in January, as traders gathering in online chat forums have gone on to take large bets on the stock using options, often out-of-the-money calls that pay off only if the stock rises in value over a set period.

Traders on sites like Reddit’s WallStreetBets, and using trading platforms including Robinhood (which in its initial conception was meant to be a social platform organized around the trading of stocks), have clashed with hedge-fund investors, sparking a battle between prominent Wall Street short sellers and individual investors in GameStop shares.

A Robinhood spokeswoman said that officials at the trading platform “continuously monitor the markets and adjust as we feel necessary for the benefit of our customers.”

Robinhood said it also moved raised requirements for GameStop and AMC to 100%, emphasizing that Robinhood doesn’t allow shorting of equities or allow customers to trade naked options.

However, the recent run-up in GameStop, and AMC Entertainment, has been spilling over into other areas of the market, with the likes of Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY, -0.40% and retailer Express Inc. rocketing on Wednesday.

News alert: Outsized stock-market movers: AMC, up 225%; Express, up 140%; GameStop, up 88%

Recent volatile trade has made some on Wall Street uneasy, with worries of a rapidly inflating bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.05% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -2.04% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -2.15% were all trading lower on Wednesday.

Regulators have been mindful of the recent action, with William Galvin, Massachusetts’s secretary of the commonwealth, telling Barron’s in an exclusive statement on Tuesday that he was watching the action play out.

“This is certainly on my radar,” Galvin said. “I’m concerned, because it suggests that there is something systemically wrong with the options trading on this stock.”"	-15.18
"There are three things to remember as you watch the chaos unfolding with GameStop’s stock price. First, Wall Street is just what happens when you mix money with feelings. Second, the internet is real life. And third, the Street always wins, especially if you’re trading with Robinhood.

If you haven’t been paying attention, GameStop’s stock has been soaring in a remarkably volatile fashion; on January 22nd, GameStop zoomed upward 69 percent (nice) before it triggered a circuit breaker halt. The following Monday, January 25th, GameStop trading was halted nine times.

The idea was to punish short-sellers, and for the little guys to pummel Wall Street

On the surface, this doesn’t make sense. GameStop, founded a year before Blockbuster, is part of a dwindling cohort of IRL businesses that are being starved by online marketplaces. These days, you can just buy video games over the internet instead of going to a soul-killing strip mall in Iowa City to buy a physical copy of the game. GameStop’s business has been suffering as a result.

Currently, many people are at home and bored, and consequently, interest in day trading has shot through the roof. There is a Reddit forum for this, r/WallStreetBets, which describes itself as being “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.” A year ago, a user called delaneydi argued that GameStop was underpriced by the market. For a while, the idea that r/WallStreetBets would take over GameStop was a joke — but then it turned serious, Bloomberg reported. The idea was to punish short-sellers, and for the little guys to pummel Wall Street.

If you think GameStop will fail and the stock will go down, or even that the company will go bankrupt, there’s a way to make money on that. Typically, this is done by short selling — a practice where you borrow shares for a fee and sell them for (ideally) a high price, then buy them back at (ideally) a lower price to return them. This can make you a lot of money, especially if the company goes bankrupt and you don’t have to return the stock!

The thing about short selling, though, is that you lose money if the stock goes up, and your losses are potentially infinite if the stock keeps going up. There are several other bad things that can also happen, such as an increase in fees or the original investor wanting their stock back. This means some shorts will be forced to “cover,” or buy the stock back at a high price, which sends the price even higher.

For retail investors, this process has gotten easier and cheaper

Right now, more people are betting against GameStop than betting it will succeed. “Short interest is 71.2 million shares, while GameStop has only 69.7 million shares outstanding,” Matt Levine of Bloomberg points out. Some people will notice that kind of thing and think, Hm, this stock is prime for a short squeeze! Basically, because so many people are short, it may be possible to trigger a chain reaction where you buy enough stock to send the price up, forcing some shorts to cover, sending the price up further, forcing more shorts to cover, and so on.

For retail investors, this process has gotten easier and cheaper because of apps such as Robinhood. In addition to letting you buy and sell stock, you can easily buy an option for stock, instead of the stock itself. If you are feeling confident in a stock, you can buy a call option — which lets you buy a stock at a specific price on a specific date.

Let’s say my fake investing firm wants to buy a call option on Company X. Currently, shares of Company X are trading at $10. I feel confident in Company X, so I buy options that let me buy 100 shares of Company X stock for $25 a share on March 1st. This contract is usually cheaper than the share price.

So let’s say Company X goes on an epic run in February, and by February 15th, it’s up to $50 a share. I can sell my options for more than I paid for them, if I want. Or I can continue to hold onto them until March 1st, when I take delivery of the 100 shares, which are now trading at $55 a share, and immediately sell them. As a result, I make a profit of $30 per share, minus whatever fees I paid for the options.

Stocks are memes now, and you trade them to show off to your friends

On the other hand, maybe I bet badly and Company X only gets up to $20. In that case, my losses are limited to whatever fees I paid for my options — I just never buy the shares. This makes options a riskier bet than just buying Company X stock directly, because I might just lose all the money I spent on the options, instead of at least getting to own the stock. But it means there’s a lot more upside as well, because I didn’t have to spend all the money on the stock upfront. If risk is your idea of fun, options are great!

Now, someone has to be on the other end of my trade. The outfit that sold me the options is going to try to reduce the risk that my options will hurt them, and they will do this by buying stock in Company X. That makes the stock go up, and the further up the stock goes, the more stock my counterparty will have to buy.

Options were once a fairly sophisticated thing to trade — something ordinary people didn’t really do. But Robinhood makes the option trades easy and free. Plus, there’s a social aspect to the trades — which is where r/WallStreetBets come in. Stocks are memes now, and you trade them to show off to your friends.

Day traders, such as the ones on r/WallStreetBets, are typically held in contempt by professional traders, and they are acutely aware of this. The professional short-sellers who created the possibility of a short squeeze underestimated the day traders’ sophistication, and r/WallStreetBets pounced. Time to troll Wall Street out of a fuckload of money!

GameStop’s short-sellers have been trolled out of about $5 billion in 2021

The fine people of r/WallStreetBets decided GameStop was undervalued, and the stock would go up, so they put up a bunch of posts about how they were buying GameStop options. This drove up the stock price for GameStop, as their counterparties had to load up on stock to balance, and then more stock as more people bought options and so on. The soaring stock meant some shorts had to cover, sending the stock up further. As of January 26th, short-sellers have been trolled out of about $5 billion in 2021, just from their GameStop positions alone.

What does Robinhood have to do with this? Well, it makes options trading much more accessible to retail investors — but there’s something else. Trades on Robinhood are free! But Robinhood isn’t offering free trades to be nice; the company gets paid by some big-time investors such as Citadel Securities to see what retail investors are doing. This phenomenon, which other brokerages are engaged in as well, is called payment for order flow. Citadel Securities makes its money on these orders by “automatically taking the other side of the order, then returning to the market to flip the trade. It pockets the difference between the price to buy and sell, known as the spread,” according to the Financial Times.

The argument in favor of this practice is, essentially, retail investors get better prices than they would on the open market, Bloomberg’s Levine writes. The practice is controversial, though, because some critics say it harms investors. It’s theoretically possible to “‘front run’ orders by, for example, jumping ahead of a customer’s stock purchase to buy it themselves, making a small gain if the share price increases,” the Financial Times explains. “There is no suggestion that Citadel Securities engages in such activity, which is prohibited by SEC.”

Robinhood got in trouble with the SEC for “misleading statements and omissions” about how it made its money by selling the orders its traders made to other firms. According to the SEC, Robinhood investors got second-rate prices, which cost them a collective $34.1 million. The company paid a $65 million fine in December to settle charges, and the practices the SEC objected to “do not reflect Robinhood today,” Dan Gallagher, the brokerage’s chief legal officer, told Business Insider.

Wall Street can also get in on screwing Wall Street

When asked for comment, Robinhood referred to an op-ed published by Vlad Tenev, the company’s CEO and co-founder. The company says its customers are mostly “buy and hold” investors, not reckless ones. The op-ed said nothing about payment for order flow, and Robinhood declined to comment on the practice in a follow-up email.

Citadel Securities is winning on this, though! Last June, the company was responsible for 40 percent of shares traded by retail investors, the Financial Times wrote, citing Piper Sandler. It doesn’t just get Robinhood’s orders either — TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab also work with Citadel Securities. “Not only are retail market makers getting increased trading volume, they are likely getting increased profitability per trade,” Tyler Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets Association, told the FT.

Which means that Wall Street can also get in on screwing Wall Street. And it’s not just Citadel Securities. I’d be very surprised if high-frequency trading algorithms weren’t also getting in on the fun. Plus, Chamath Palihapitiya, the Silicon Valley SPAC icon, has decided to yolo along with the Redditors. (“Yolo” as a verb appears to be part of the r/WallStreetBets peculiar parlance.) Elon Musk, a man who notoriously hates short-sellers, is also observing the chaos.

At least one Wall Street firm has taken heavy losses — Melvin Capital Management, which was shorting GameStop, among other bets. It’s been bailed out by Citadel, which, confusingly, is not the same thing as Citadel Securities. (Citadel is a hedge fund, not a market maker.) Both firms were founded by the same guy, though: Ken Griffin. And by bailing out Melvin, Griffin got “a rare opportunity to invest in a talented manager on the cheap,” according to Bloomberg.

What does this have to do with GameStop itself? Absolutely nothing — this is a weird game now. And the market’s frothy, too; in July, I joined Robinhood to see how it works. The Verge’s ethics policy forbids us from directly trading stock in companies we cover, so for research purposes I picked six stocks that belong to companies I don’t cover because their earnings were next on the calendar. (I actually don’t know what several of them do.) I am a buy-and-hold investor because I am a bore, but as of today I’m a bore who’s up 30 percent. One more time: I know nothing about these companies except that I won’t have to write about them. It’s easy to feel like a genius in a bull market, and a lot of first-time day traders are probably very bullish on their investing sense right now.

At this point you may be wondering whether what r/WallStreetBets is doing is illegal — after all, it’s a group of people trying to artificially drive up a stock price in order to sell for outsized profits. And the answer is: well, maybe? It definitely seems like a pump-and-dump scheme, but — this part is crucial — no one’s lying, as Bloomberg’s Levine points out. Theoretically, the SEC could chase down the r/WallStreetBets investors, since no one’s really anonymous on the internet, but this seems like a lot of effort for what is not actually a slam-dunk case. It is “an enforcement nightmare,” James Cox, a professor at Duke University School of Law, tells Bloomberg.

it’s not just GameStop anymore

Also, GameStop’s shorts seem undeterred — as some older shorts are getting out of the market, they’re being replaced by new ones. Perhaps this is because they are anticipating the “dump” portion of the pump-and-dump scheme; perhaps this is because they’re awaiting quarterly earnings, which usually tanks GameStop’s stock. Maybe they’re just having fun, too!

But: it’s not just GameStop anymore. r/WallStreetBets is yoloing its way into electric carmaker Nio, OG tech company Blackberry, and AMC, the movie theater chain. And if those day traders are doing it, then the market makers that buy the order flow from Robinhood are yoloing along for the ride. And one thing is clear: what Citadel Securities is doing is legal.

So what happens next? I don’t know — but I suspect that someone on Wall Street will find a way to make money on it."	-15.18
"Washington (CNN) The Senate tabled an effort by Sen. Rand Paul Tuesday to force a vote on the constitutionality of former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, but the vote offered an indicator for how Republican senators -- who overwhelmingly voted for Paul's measure -- feel about the trial.

Paul's motion was killed on a 55-45 vote, with five Republicans joining all Democrats, meaning 45 Republicans voted for Paul's effort. Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania crossed party lines to vote with Democrats.

In order to convict Trump at his trial, at least 17 Republicans will need to vote with all Democrats when the trial begins next month. Significantly, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell sided with Paul in the vote -- a potential indicator that he agrees the constitutionality of impeaching a former President is in question.

Paul argued after the vote that the fact that 45 Republicans sided with him ""shows that impeachment is dead on arrival.""

""If you voted that it was unconstitutional then how in the world would you ever hope to convict somebody for this?"" Paul asked, adding ,""45 of us, almost the entire caucus, 95% of the caucus, voted that the whole proceeding was unconstitutional. This is a big victory for us. Democrats can beat this partisan horse as long as they want -- this vote indicates it's over, the trial is all over.""

"Mitch McConnell joins Rand Paul in vote that casts doubt on Trump impeachment conviction

Morgan Watkins | Louisville Courier Journal

Show Caption Hide Caption Rand Paul: Impeaching Trump 'antithesis of unity' Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is challenging the legitimacy of Donald Trump's second impeachment trial and forced a Senate vote on whether the impeachment trial of a former president is Constitutional. The vote failed 55 to 45. (Jan. 26) AP

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell joined Sen. Rand Paul in a Tuesday vote challenging the constitutionality of former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.

Paul, R-Ky., forced the vote, but his motion was struck down.

However, McConnell and most other Republican senators sided with Paul on the vote, signaling they see the trial as unconstitutional and casting doubt on the likelihood there will be enough votes to convict Trump.

""This impeachment is nothing more than a partisan exercise designed to further divide the country,"" said Paul, who falsely claimed last month the presidential election ""in many ways was stolen.""

The U.S. House of Representatives recently impeached Trump, charging him with inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

Pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol that day and forced Congress to temporarily halt its certification of President Joe Biden's victory. The riot resulted in the deaths of a U.S. Capitol Police officer and four other people.

Earlier: Rand Paul calls Trump impeachment a 'sham,' calls for boycott

Paul and other senators were sworn in Tuesday afternoon for the impeachment trial, although the substantive part of that process won't get rolling in earnest until the week of Feb. 8.

As the initial proceedings got underway Tuesday, Paul raised a point of order challenging the trial's constitutionality, forcing a vote. The Senate rejected Paul's motion in a 55-45 vote, affirming the trial's constitutionality.

Paul made two main points concerning why he thinks the process is unconstitutional: Trump is no longer president and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts won't be presiding over the trial.

Citing specific parts of the U.S. Constitution, Paul said: ""Therefore I make a point of order that this proceeding, which would try a private citizen and not a president, a vice president or civil officer, violates the Constitution and is not in order.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed Paul's argument and pointed out the consequences of being impeached and convicted can include not only removal from office but also disqualification from holding federal office in the future.

""The theory that the impeachment of a former official is unconstitutional is flat-out wrong by every frame of analysis: constitutional context, historical practice, precedent and basic common sense,"" the New York Democrat said. ""It's been completely debunked by constitutional scholars from all across the political spectrum.""

Earlier Tuesday, Paul acknowledged he was unlikely to win with this gambit but suggested it could demonstrate whether the Senate is likely to convict Trump, which would require the support of two-thirds of the chamber.

After his motion was struck down, Paul said on Twitter: ""45 Senators agreed that this sham of a 'trial' is unconstitutional. That is more than will be needed to acquit and to eventually end this partisan impeachment process. This 'trial' is dead on arrival in the Senate.""

McConnell got pushback from some fellow Kentucky Republicans last week for not standing with Trump during his second impeachment, although the Republican Party of Kentucky's State Central Committee nixed a resolution that would have urged him to fully support Trump and condemn the impeachment.

McConnell publicly said last week that Trump provoked the mob that violently breached the Capitol — an act he has condemned as a ""failed insurrection.""

He has not publicly said whether he plans to vote to convict or acquit Trump, but his vote Tuesday appeared to be a public show of opposition to the trial and its legitimacy.

Before he formally raised his point of order on Tuesday, Paul gave a speech on the Senate floor in which he made it clear he does not think Trump incited an insurrection.

He also criticized Democrats for pursuing this impeachment process. (The House's vote to impeach Trump included several GOP supporters, although the vast majority of the chamber's conservative members opposed it.)

“Instead of doing the nation’s work with their new majorities in the House, the Senate and the executive branch, Democrats are wasting the nation’s time on a partisan vendetta against a man no longer in office,” Paul said in Tuesday's speech. “Without him as their boogeyman, they might have to legislate and to actually convince Americans that their policy prescriptions are the right ones.

""This sham of an impeachment will ostensibly ask whether the (former) president incited the reprehensible behavior and violence of Jan. 6 when he said: 'I know everyone here will soon march to the Capitol to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.' Peacefully and patriotically — hardly words of violence,"" Paul said.

The speech Paul referenced was one Trump gave Jan. 6, not long before the Capitol riot began, to a crowd of supporters in Washington, D.C. During that rally, Trump repeated his patently false claims that the election was ""stolen"" from him.

The article of impeachment the House approved charges Trump with inciting an insurrection, in part by falsely claiming the election was marred by widespread fraud and its results should not be accepted.

The impeachment article also cites the speech Trump gave Jan. 6 and says: ""He also willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore'.""

The last stop for the crazy train that has been Team Trump’s effort to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election will arrive on Wednesday, January 6, when Congress meets in a joint session to recognize the results. Trump supporters in both houses have announced that they intend to challenge enough of the 306 electors Biden won to either flip the election to the incumbent or throw it into the U.S. House.

The January 6 session is normally a pro forma exercise in which the vice-president, in his capacity as presiding officer of the Senate, is required to “open” certificates from the states naming presidential electors. The electors are then counted, leading to the affirmation of a winner entitled to be inaugurated on January 20, assuming someone captures a majority.

These provisions, which are laid out in the 12th Amendment, are supplemented by the poorly drafted and much maligned Electoral Count Act of 1887, which provides detailed guidance for contested presidential elections. It’s the Electoral Count Act, as interpreted over the decades, that was the basis for the specific rules for this year’s process adopted via a voice vote in both congressional chambers soon after the 117th Congress was sworn in over the weekend.

What’s the Purpose of the January 6 Session?

It’s often said that the constitutionally required session is intended to “certify” the results, which may be true in the colloquial sense of the word — however, that can create confusion as to whether Congress, rather than the states, actually “certifies” electors. Under the Electoral Count Act, Congress is required to count state-certified electors if they are chosen, and legal disputes are resolved by the “safe-harbor deadline” the statute sets out (six days before electoral votes are formally cast; this cycle, it fell on December 8). So as George Washington University’s Sarah Binder points out, the proper term for what Congress will do on January 6 is to “count,” not “certify,” the electoral votes for each state.

This usually happens without incident, though there was a brief and largely symbolic protest of Ohio’s electoral votes by a handful of Democrats in 2004 (not sanctioned by John Kerry), and in 1960 there was a moment of confusion over Hawaii’s electoral votes since the state’s governor had certified two different results (before and after a judicially ordered recount; Vice-President Richard Nixon defused a possible challenge to the earlier certification in his favor by recognizing the final electors pledged to his opponent, John F. Kennedy).

What Is Pence’s Role in the Process?

As noted above, the Constitution merely specifies that the vice-president will “open” certificates from the states conveying the winning Electoral College slates. The Electoral Count Act obliges the veep to “announce” the electors from each state, as certified by the appropriate state executive official (usually the governor). There is no indication in either statute that the vice-president has the power to disregard state certifications, or, for that matter, to choose between competing certifications (avoiding that problem, which deadlocked the 1876 presidential election for months, was the main reason for passage of the Electoral Count Act in the first place). So according to law and precedent, Pence is confined to the merely administrative chore of opening the certifications state elected officials have sent to Congress, arranging for their tabulation and then noting any challenges to a given state’s announced electors from members of Congress.

There is some reporting that Pence is acknowledging his very limited role, though it appears his boss, Donald Trump, does not agree with that characterization or will let him off the hook for not doing more:

The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2021

Pence did object to a lawsuit filed by House troglodyte Louie Gohmert (given short shrift by the courts) seeking to strike down the Electoral Count Act as an unconstitutional restraint on the vice-president’s allegedly plenary power to choose electors. But on the other hand, he has publicly encouraged Republicans to challenge the electoral-vote count and has been present at some of the planning meetings for the coup at the White House.

If Pence does “go rogue,” he might theoretically “announce” that some or all of the “alternative electors” pledged to Trump that rump assemblages of Republicans unofficially chose in seven 2020 states carried by Biden (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) are the “real” electors, or he might name both Biden and Trump electors as having been “certified.” Either way, it’s not likely the sergeant at arms will haul Pence off in leg-irons for violating the Constitution and federal law; Congress will probably have to overrule him.

How Does Congress Raise Electoral-Vote Challenges?

Under the Electoral Count Act, any one House member and any one senator can together challenge any state’s announced electoral votes. Team Trump has already assembled an estimated 30 House members (and the number will probably go much higher) willing to take that step on the president’s behalf, and 12 senators have formally announced they will do so as well. If that happens, the joint session of Congress will temporarily adjourn and each House will hold a debate over the challenge that will not exceed two hours (individual speakers in such debates are limited to five minutes), followed by a vote on the challenge. It requires a majority vote in both chambers to overturn a state’s announced electoral votes.

How Long Will the Debate on Electoral-Vote Challenges Last?

The answer to this question will depend on how many electoral-vote challenges the protesters choose to make. Since one of the seven states with “alternative” Trump electors wasn’t at all close (Biden won New Mexico by double digits), the most likely number of challenges is six. If Team Trump can find enough “debaters” to fill the maximum time allowed, or if those opposing the challenges choose to dignify them with a response, these “debates” could consume 12 hours, though the challengers aren’t expected to come up with any evidence beyond the unsupported assertions that have been rejected by federal and state courts in the 60 lawsuits Trump’s lawyers filed.

January 6 could be a long and tedious day, enlivened (and not in a good way) by the MAGA hordes Trump has asked to come to Washington to support his last hurrah.

What Is This Election Commission the Pro-Trump Challengers Are Demanding?

In a small wrinkle, the official position of the pro-Trump challengers in the Senate is that Biden’s election should be stopped pending the establishment of an “election commission” charged with investigating election-fraud allegations that will report its recommendations before Inaugural Day. As their statement of intent notes, that’s what Congress did in 1876 when the Hayes-Tilden presidential election went into overtime with four disputed states.

The problem with claiming the 1877 commission as precedent is that it did not in fact resolve the dispute: It voted on partisan lines to accept Hayes electors from all the dispute states. Only after a secretly negotiated deal known later as the Compromise of 1877 (in which Republicans agreed to end the last vestiges of military Reconstruction in the South in exchange for another four years of White House control) did Democrats accept the commission’s recommendation and end the crisis. But in any event, the commission preceded the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which was clearly intended to end serious electoral-vote challenges once and for all. In other words: The commission demand is a complete red herring.

How Will the Challenges End?

There is no chance either the Democratic-controlled House or the Senate controlled by Republicans who oppose the challenge categorically (20 of them have publicly announced opposition) will vote to reject any state’s Biden electors. If Pence does “go rogue” and change the dynamics by “announcing” Trump electors or leaving the choice between Biden and Trump electors to Congress, then a majority vote to overturn his determinations should not be any harder. So this whole exercise is a waste of time and attention, unless you consider a further effort to undermine confidence in our electoral system as time well spent."	-15.18
"(CNN) Vice President Mike Pence came closer than initially known to the mob of pro-Trump rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, according to new reporting from the Washington Post.

Senators were alerted that protesters had breached the Capitol building just one minute earlier, according to CNN's timeline of events from last Wednesday's riot. Pence wouldn't be evacuated from the Senate until 2:30 p.m.

The Post's report of how close the rioters were to Pence stresses the level of danger he and other government leaders faced during the January 6 insurrection. Some of the pro-Trump rioters who rampaged the US Capitol were heard screaming ""where's Mike Pence"" and seen on video shouting ""hang Mike Pence"" — upset that Pence was doing his constitutional duty to certify the November election results.

Pence, per the Post, remained in the Senate chamber for about 14 minutes after Capitol Police reported the initial attempted breach of the building.

"After a mob stormed the Capitol based on President Donald Trump's election fraud lie, some top Republican allies have called for peace while still leveling the same baseless claims of widespread voter fraud that fanned the flames of violence.

In almost the same breath as he condemned the rioters who temporarily disrupted Congress' normal process of affirming President-elect Joe Biden's win, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, the first Republican to announce his intention to object to the certification, suggested that Biden's victory was illegitimate.

“We do need an investigation into irregularities, fraud,” Hawley said before staring directly into the camera in a video that his office would promptly upload to YouTube and saying: “We do need a way forward together. We need election security reforms.”

In a statement, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, condemned the violence, too. Still, he said, his calls for an investigation into voter fraud were the “right thing to do"" before adding, “I very much wish Congress had not set aside these concerns.”

Republicans have used allegations of voter fraud and irregularities to sow distrust in the American electoral system for decades, experts said, laying the groundwork for Trump's sweeping claim that widespread fraud denied him a second term and priming the party's base to believe him despite his inability to prove it. The same falsehoods, the experts said, will be used to restrict access to the ballot box in the future.

""The same lies that drove the insurrections were also being repeated on the floor of the Congress by the people trying to upend the people’s votes,"" said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. ""And those are the same lies we’re going to hear in state capitols by people trying to restrict the vote.""

Hawley and Cruz, who are widely believed to be considering running for president in 2024, have been fiercely criticized for their roles in stoking the unrest that led to the deadly clashes in the nation's capital.

After weeks of defending Trump's claims of a stolen election with statements of concern about widespread voter fraud that doesn't exist, they led the effort in the Senate to object to the certification of Biden's victory in the Electoral College while ignoring the facts. Since November, there had been numerous hand counts, audits, legal challenges and investigations into voter fraud that turned up nothing to support Trump's claim and the senators' justification for challenging Biden's victory. Nonetheless, Republican senators have argued that further investigation is warranted.

In an interview with NBC Dallas-Fort Worth on Thursday, Cruz said he was ""debating"" election integrity, which he said ""has nothing to do with this criminal terrorist assault.""

Hawley, responding to calls for his resignation, stood by his decision to object to the certification of the election. “I will never apologize for giving voice to the millions of Missourians and Americans who have concerns about the integrity of our elections. That’s my job, and I will keep doing it,” he said in a statement Thursday.

Before the election, Trump and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits trying to limit mail voting and to make it more difficult and challenging longstanding mail voting mechanisms, like drop boxes. Some courts protested at the lack of evidence the campaign presented. After Biden won, Trump and his allies filed at least 57 lawsuits across the county contesting the results with allegations of fraud and irregularities; 50 have been denied, dismissed or withdrawn, according to NBC News’ tally. Former Attorney General William Barr, still leading the Justice Department at the time, said no widespread fraud was evident. Republican officials in Arizona and Georgia, which Biden flipped blue, withstood enormous pressure from Trump and his allies to vouch for the integrity of the results, with some fact-checking Trump in public and private to try and counter misinformation.

""There have already been investigations conducted by election officials, by investigative journalists and by courts. There’s really nothing left to investigate,"" said Rick Hasen, a professor and election law expert at the University of California, Irvine. ""This election was perhaps the most watched, and perhaps for that reason, the cleanest election I think we’ve seen in American political history.""

'The base was completely prepared'

Trump didn't invent claims of a rigged election — he simply turned up the volume, experts said.

It was after the recount of Florida's votes in the 2000 election, which led to a court battle that ended when the Supreme Court sided with Republican George W. Bush, ""that people realized things were really narrowly divided and that you could win or lose based on restricting turnout and the vote or bolstering turnout and the vote,"" Waldman said. ""Very quickly you started to hear Republicans making increasingly insistent claims of voter fraud.""

In the years since then, Republicans in state legislatures have written and passed numerous restrictive voting laws, while federal and state investigations hunted for proof of fraud. The Justice Department has investigated it; states have launched their own investigations. Advocacy groups and nonprofits were founded in the name of preventing or rooting out voter fraud.

While the suppressive effect of such laws has been well documented, there’s still no proof that there is widespread voter fraud. When fraud occurs, it is isolated and rare.

By the time Trump took office, voter fraud was a common belief among Republicans. A majority of Republicans said it was a ""major problem"" in August 2016, according to a Gallup survey.

""No matter how powerful his bully pulpit, he wouldn't have a fertile — he wouldn't have a willing audience if this had not been repeated so many times over the years in a more polite voice,"" Waldman said.

Trump's voter fraud lie began in his first days in office, when he claimed that it cost him the popular vote. He launched a commission to dig up proof, which disbanded without ever finding any.

As states sought to adapt their election plans to accommodate the pandemic in 2020, Trump alleged that the expansion of mail-in voting — a common and secure system often used by Republicans — was creating opportunities for widespread fraud. His campaign and the Republican Party filed many lawsuits seeking judicial intervention, most of which were withdrawn or dismissed for lack of evidence.

“The base was completely prepared to believe the kind of outlandish things that Trump said,"" Hasen said.

Even after the deadly riots Wednesday, Republican lawmakers are still advancing falsehoods about American elections.

Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the Georgia Republican who lost her runoff race Tuesday, said she couldn’t “in good conscience” object to the certification of the election results after the mob attack.

But she nonetheless cast doubt on the results: “I believe that there were last-minute changes to the November 2020 election process and serious irregularities that resulted in too many Americans losing confidence not only in the integrity of our elections but in the power of the ballot as a tool of democracy.”

Georgia has conducted multiple recounts and found no evidence of fraud. The change in Georgia’s election code was made nearly a year ago when the state agreed to standardize signature-matching policies across its many counties. That meant election workers were trained and prepared ahead of time for an election that had unprecedented use of the state’s 15-year-old mail-ballot system. Republican election officials have characterized the changes as a strengthening of the signature-match system.

Waldman said it's hard to find anything in the history of American politics comparable to the voter fraud myth, so thoroughly disproportionate is the reality of the threat to the response.

At least during McCarthyism, he joked, ""there were actual communists.""

None of the Republicans questioning Biden's victory have questioned the victories of down-ballot Republicans. House Republicans, particularly, won sizable gains in the general election.

A Republican member of Congress argued that if the Supreme Court had heard arguments in one of the many lawsuits challenging the election, the riots could have been prevented.

“The American people deserved a decision on the merit of numerous claims of unconstitutionality, irregularity, and fraud. It was their duty. They failed,” Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, said in a statement posted on social media.

Hasen countered: “The Supreme Court didn’t dismiss the case because the justices were trying to avoid deciding hard issues. The justices didn’t hear the cases because they lacked merit.”

'Deadly consequences'

At least one key Trump ally repudiated Trump's central fraud claim in the wake of Wednesday's chaos.

In the days after Biden's win, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who chairs the powerful Judiciary Committee, called for an investigation into claims of fraud in Pennsylvania, repeatedly expressed concerns about the integrity of the election and called up election officials in Georgia, Nevada and Arizona.

After the riot, Graham, a staunch defender and golfing partner of the president's, gave an impassioned speech on the Senate floor decrying the lack of evidence provided by Trump's legal team to support any of the claims.

""They said there's 66,000 people in Georgia under 18 voted. How many people believed that? I asked, 'Give me 10.' They didn’t have one. They said 8,000 felons in prison voted. I said, 'Give me 10.' Hadn't got one,"" Graham said Wednesday night. ""I don't buy this. Enough's enough. We've got to end it.""

Former White House communications director Alyssa Farah said Friday on MSNBC that Trump had known for months that he had lost the election and declined to be honest with his supporters, who believed him when he said it had been stolen.

""I believe that he knew he lost and that those around him did. And that's why it was very troubling for me to see the public misled,"" she said. ""The lack of honesty with the public, you know, ended up having deadly consequences.""

Election officials across the country who have been harassed and threatened since the election had warned that Trump's rhetoric would lead to real-world violence.

"President Donald Trump spoke at a rally near the White House on Jan. 6 before a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol to try to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Trump was impeached Wednesday by the U.S. House on a single charge of “incitement of insurrection.”

Here's a transcript of Trump's Jan. 6 speech:

___

Well, thank you very much. This is incredible.

Media will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when I turned on today, I looked, and I saw thousands of people here. But you don’t see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they don’t want to show that.

Trump Supporters Storm Capitol Building View All 44 Images

We have hundreds of thousands of people here and I just want them to be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras please and show what’s really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer. They’re not going to take it any longer. Go ahead. Turn your cameras, please. Would you show? They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country.

I just really want to see what they do. I just want to see how they covered. I’ve never seen anything like it. But it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media. The media is the biggest problem we have as far as I’m concerned, single biggest problem. The fake news and the Big tech.

Big tech is now coming into their own. We beat them four years ago. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and this year they rigged an election. They rigged it like they’ve never rigged an election before. And by the way, last night they didn’t do a bad job either if you notice.

I’m honest. And I just, again, I want to thank you. It’s just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you and hundreds of thousands of American patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic.

All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats, which is what they’re doing. And stolen by the fake news media. That’s what they’ve done and what they’re doing. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.

Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that’s what this is all about. And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the steal. Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election.

You know, I say, sometimes jokingly, but there’s no joke about it: I’ve been in two elections. I won them both and the second one, I won much bigger than the first. OK. Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country, 12 million more people than four years ago.

And I was told by the real pollsters — we do have real pollsters — they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn’t go to 66, we went to 75 million, and they say we lost. We didn’t lose.

And by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that? He had 80 million computer votes. It’s a disgrace. There’s never been anything like that. You could take third-world countries. Just take a look. Take third-world countries. Their elections are more honest than what we’ve been going through in this country. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace.

Even when you look at last night. They’re all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes. Nobody knows what the hell is going on. There’s never been anything like this.

We will not let them silence your voices. We’re not going to let it happen, I’m not going to let it happen.

(Audience chants: “Fight for Trump.”)

Thank you.

And I’d love to have if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed. The military, the secret service. And we want to thank you and the police law enforcement. Great. You’re doing a great job. But I’d love it if they could be allowed to come up here with us. Is that possible? Can you just let him come up, please?

And Rudy, you did a great job. He’s got guts. You know what? He’s got guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican Party. He’s got guts. He fights, he fights.

And I’ll tell you. Thank you very much, John. Fantastic job. I watched. That’s a tough act to follow, those two. John is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country, and he looked at this and he said, “What an absolute disgrace that this can be happening to our Constitution.”

And he looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so.

Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. All he has to do, all this is, this is from the number one, or certainly one of the top, Constitutional lawyers in our country. He has the absolute right to do it. We’re supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our Constitution, and protect our constitution.

States want to revote. The states got defrauded, They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people.

And I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I said: “Mike, that doesn’t take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage.” And then we’re stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more years. We’re just not going to let that happen.

Many of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here, and I want to thank you for the extraordinary love. That’s what it is. There’s never been a movement like this, ever, ever. For the extraordinary love for this amazing country, and this amazing movement, thank you.

(Audience chants: “We love Trump.”)

By the way, this goes all the way back past the Washington Monument. You believe this? Look at this. That is. Unfortunately gave, they gave the press the prime seats. I can’t stand that.

No. But you look at that behind. I wish they’d flip those cameras and look behind you. That is the most amazing sight. When they make a mistake, you get to see it on television. Amazing. Amazing. All the way back.

And don’t worry, we will not take the name off the Washington Monument. We will not cancel culture.

You know they wanted to get rid of the Jefferson Memorial. Either take it down or just put somebody else in there. I don’t think that’s going to happen. It damn well better not. Although, with this administration, if this happens, it could happen. You’ll see some really bad things happen.

They’ll knock out Lincoln too, by the way. They’ve been taking his statue down. But then we signed a little law. You hurt our monuments, you hurt our heroes, you go to jail for 10 years, and everything stopped. You notice that? It stopped. It all stopped.

And they could use Rudy back in New York City. Rudy. They could use you. Your city’s going to hell. They want Rudy Giuliani back in New York. We’ll get a little younger version of Rudy. Is that OK, Rudy?

We’re gathered together in the heart of our nation’s capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: To save our democracy.

You know most candidates on election evening and, of course, this thing goes on so long. They still don’t have any idea what the votes are. We still have congressional seats under review. They have no idea. They’ve totally lost control. They’ve used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election.

But you know, you know, when you see this and when you see what’s happening. Number one, they all say, “Sir, we’ll never let it happen again.” I said, “That’s good. But what about eight weeks ago?” You know they try and get you to go.

They said, “Sir, in four years, you’re guaranteed.” I said: “I’m not interested right now. Do me a favor, go back eight weeks. I want to go back eight weeks. Let’s go back eight weeks.”

We want to go back and we want to get this right because we’re going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we’re not going to stand for that.

For years, Democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak Republicans. And that’s what they are. There’s so many weak Republicans. And we have great ones. Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they’re out there fighting. The House guys are fighting. But it’s, it’s incredible.

Many of the Republicans, I helped them get in, I helped them get elected. I helped Mitch get elected. I helped. I could name 24 of them, let’s say, I won’t bore you with it. And then all of a sudden you have something like this. It’s like, “Oh gee, maybe I’ll talk to the president sometime later.” No, it’s amazing.

They’re weak Republicans, they’re pathetic Republicans and that’s what happens.

If this happened to the Democrats, there’d be hell all over the country going on. There’d be hell all over the country. But just remember this: You’re stronger, you’re smarter, you’ve got more going than anybody. And they try and demean everybody having to do with us. And you’re the real people, you’re the people that built this nation. You’re not the people that tore down our nation.

The weak Republicans, and that’s it. I really believe it. I think I’m going to use the term, the weak Republicans. You’ve got a lot of them. And you got a lot of great ones. But you got a lot of weak ones. They’ve turned a blind eye, even as Democrats enacted policies that chipped away our jobs, weakened our military, threw open our borders and put America last.

Did you see the other day where Joe Biden said, I want to get rid of the America First policy? What’s that all about? Get rid of. How do you say I want to get rid of America First? Even if you’re going to do it, don’t talk about it, right? Unbelievable what we have to go through. What we have to go through.

And you have to get your people to fight. And if they don’t fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don’t fight. You primary them. We’re going to. We’re going to let you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly.

But this year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft and there’s never been anything like this. So pure theft in American history. Everybody knows it.

That election, our election was over at 10 o’clock in the evening. We’re leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, by hundreds of thousands of votes.

And then late in the evening, or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bull——.

And all of a sudden. All of a sudden it started to happen.

(Audience chants: “Bull——.”)

Don’t forget when Romney got beat. Romney, hey. Did you see his? I wonder if he enjoyed his flight in last night. But when Romney got beaten, you know, he stands up like you’re more typical, “Well, I’d like to congratulate the victor.” The victor? Who is the victor, Mitt? “I’d like to congratulate.” They don’t go and look at the facts. No, I don’t know. He got, he got slaughtered. Probably, maybe it was OK, maybe it was. But that’s what happened.

But we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country we’ve never seen anything like it. You can go all the way back.

You know, America is blessed with elections. All over the world they talk about our elections. You know what the world says about us now? They said, we don’t have free and fair elections.

And you know what else? We don’t have a free and fair press. Our media is not free, it’s not fair. It suppresses thought, it suppresses speech and it’s become the enemy of the people. It’s become the enemy of the people. It’s the biggest problem we have in this country.

No third-world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing. And you’ll hear about that in just a few minutes.

Republicans are, Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It’s like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we’re going to have to fight much harder.

And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn’t, that will be a, a sad day for our country because you’re sworn to uphold our Constitution.

Now, it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we’re going to walk down, and I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down.

Anyone you want, but I think right here, we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.

Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.

I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.

Today we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections. But whether or not they stand strong for our country, our country. Our country has been under siege for a long time. Far longer than this four-year period. We’ve set it on a much greater course. So much, and we, I thought, you know, four more years. I thought it would be easy.

We’ve created the greatest economy in history. We rebuilt our military. We get you the biggest tax cuts in history. Right? We got you the biggest regulation cuts. There’s no president, whether it’s four years, eight years or in one case more, got anywhere near the regulation cuts.

Used to take 20 years to get a highway approved, now we’re down to two. I want to get it down to one, but we’re down to two. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we got it down to safety.

We created Space Force, We, we, we. Look at what we did. Our military has been totally rebuilt. So we create Space Force which, by and of itself, is a major achievement for an administration. And with us it’s one of so many different things.

Right to Try. Everybody know about Right to Try. We did things that nobody ever thought possible. We took care of our vets, our vets. The VA now has the highest rating, 91%. The highest rating that it’s had from the beginning, 91% approval rating. Always, you watch the VA, it was on television every night, people living in a horrible, horrible manner. We got that done. We got accountability done. We got it so that now in the VA, you don’t have to wait for four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, four months to see a doctor. If you can’t get a doctor, you go outside, you get the doctor. You have it taken care of and we pay the doctor.

And we’ve not only made life wonderful for so many people, we’ve saved tremendous amounts of money, far secondarily, but we’ve saved a lot of money. And now we have the right to fire bad people in the VA. We had 9,000 people that treated our veterans horribly. In primetime, they would not have treated our veterans badly. But they treated our veterans horribly.

And we have what’s called the account, VA Accountability Act. And the accountability says if we see somebody in there that doesn’t treat our vets well or they steal, they rob, they do things badly, we say: “Joe you’re fired. Get out of here.” Before you couldn’t do that. You couldn’t do that before.

So we’ve taken care of things, we’ve done things like nobody’s ever thought possible. And that’s part of the reason that many people don’t like us, because we’ve done too much.

But we’ve done it quickly and we were going to sit home and watch a big victory and everybody had us down for a victory. It was going to be great and now we’re out here fighting. I said to somebody, I was going to take a few days and relax after our big electoral victory. 10 o’clock it was over. But I was going to take a few days.

And I can say this. Since our election, I believe, which was such a catastrophe, when I watch. And even these guys knew what happened. They know what happened. They’re saying: “Wow, Pennsylvania’s insurmountable. Wow, Wisconsin.” Look at the big leads we had, right. Even though the press said we would lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Even though the press said, Ohio’s going to be close, we set a record; Florida’s going to be close, we set a record; Texas is going to be close, Texas is going to be close, we set a record.

And we set a record with Hispanic, with the Black community, we set a record with everybody.

Today we see a very important event though. Because right over there, right there, we see the event going to take place. And I’m going to be watching. Because history is going to be made. We’re going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders, or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity they’ll be ashamed.

And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget.

With only three of the seven states in question, we win the presidency of the United States. And by the way, it’s much more important today than it was 24 hours ago, because I don’t. I spoke to David Perdue, what a great person, and Kelly Loeffler, two great people, but it was a setup.

And you know, I said, “We have no backline anymore.” The only backline, the only line of demarcation, the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the United States. So this is now, what we’re doing, a far more important election than it was two days ago.

I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors. They’re over there working like you’ve never seen before. Studying, talking, actually going all the way back, studying the roots of the Constitution, because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten.

They gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted because what did they know? And then when they found out a few weeks later, again, it took them four years to devise this screen.

And the only unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy, is Hillary Clinton. Because she said: “Why didn’t you do this for me four years ago? Why didn’t you do this for me four years ago? Change the votes, 10,000 in Michigan. You could have changed the whole thing.” But she’s not too happy. You know, you don’t see her anymore. What happened? Where’s Hillary? Where is she?

But I want to thank all of those congressmen and women. I also want to thank our 13, most courageous members of the U.S. Senate. Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley, Kelly Loeffler.

And Kelly Loeffler, I’ll tell you, she has been, she’s been so great. She worked so hard. So let’s give her and David a little special hand because it was rigged against them. Let’s give her and David.

Kelly Loeffler, David Purdue. They fought a good race. They never had a shot. That equipment should never have been allowed to be used, and I was telling these people don’t let him use this stuff.

Marsha Blackburn, terrific person. Mike Braun, Indiana. Steve Daines, great guy. Bill Hagerty, John Kennedy, James Lankford, Cynthia Lummis, Tommy Tuberville, the coach, and Roger Marshall. We want to thank them. Senators that stepped up, We want to thank them.

I actually think though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out and you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.

You know, we don’t want to give $2,000 to people. We want to give them $600. Oh, great. How does that play politically? Pretty good? And this has nothing to do with politics, but how does it play politically?

China destroyed these people. We didn’t destroy. China destroy them, totally destroyed them. We want to give them $600 and they just wouldn’t change.

I said give them $2,000, we’ll pay it back. We’ll pay it back fast. You already owe 26 trillion, give them a couple of bucks. Let them live. Give them a couple of bucks. And some of the people here disagree with me on that, but I just say, “Look, you’ve got to let people live.”

And how does that play though? OK. Number one, it’s the right thing to do. But how does that play politically? I think it’s the primary reason, one of the primary reasons, the other was just pure cheating. That was the primary, super primary reason. But you can’t do that, you got to use your head.

As you know, the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Have you ever seen these people? While there is no evidence of fraud. Oh, really? Well, I’m going to read you pages. I hope you don’t get bored listening to it. Promise? Don’t get bored listening to it, all those hundreds of thousands of people back there. Move them up, please, yeah.

All they, all these people, don’t get bored, don’t get angry at me because you’re going to get bored because it’s so much.

The American people do not believe the corrupt, fake news anymore. They have ruined their reputation. But you know, it used to be that they’d argue with me. I’d fight. So I’d fight, they’d fight, I’d fight, they’d fight. Pop pop. You’d believe me, you’d believe them. Somebody comes out. You know, they had their point of view, I had my point of view, but you’d have an argument.

Now what they do is they go silent. It’s called suppression and that’s what happens in a communist country. That’s what they do, they suppress. You don’t fight with them anymore. Unless it’s a bad story. They have a little bad story about me, they make it 10 times worse and it’s a major headline.

But Hunter Biden, they don’t talk about him. What happened to Hunter? Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? They don’t talk about him. They’ll watch, all the sets will go off. Well, they can’t do that because they get good ratings. Their ratings are too good. Now, where’s Hunter? You know.

And how come Joe is allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine? How does that happen? I’d ask you that question. How does that happen? Can you imagine if I said that? If I said that it would be a whole different ballgame.

And how come Hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife, and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board, even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy? And millions of dollars up front.

And how come they go into China and they leave with billions of dollars to manage. “Have you managed money before?” “No, I haven’t.” “Oh, that’s good. Here’s about 3 billion.” No, they don’t talk about that.

No, we have a corrupt media. They’ve gone silent. They’ve gone dead. I now realize how good it was if you go back 10 years, I realized how good, even though I didn’t necessarily love them, I realized how good. It was like a cleansing motion, right?

But we don’t have that anymore. We don’t have a fair media anymore. It’s suppression. And you have to be very careful with that and they’ve lost all credibility in this country.

We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we’ve been forced to believe.

Over the past several weeks, we’ve amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. This is the presidential election. Last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway.

You have one of the dumbest governors in the United States. And you know when I endorsed him, and I didn’t know this guy, at the request of David Perdue, he said, “Friend of mine’s running for governor.” “What’s his name?” And you know the rest. He was in fourth place, fifth place. I don’t know, he was, he was doing poorly. I endorse him, he went like a rocket ship and he won.

And then I had to beat Stacey Abrams with this guy, Brian Kemp. I had to beat Stacey Abrams. And I had to beat Oprah, used to be a friend of mine. You know, I was on her last show, her last week, she picked the five outstanding people. I don’t think she thinks that any more. Once I ran for president, I didn’t notice there were too many calls coming in from Oprah. Believe it or not, she used to like me. But I was one of the five outstanding people.

And I had a campaign against Michelle Obama and Barack Hussein Obama, against Stacey.

And I had Brian Kemp, who weighs 130 pounds. He said he played offensive line in football. I’m trying to figure that out. I’m still trying to figure that out. He said that the other night, “I was an offensive lineman.” I’m saying: “Really? That must have been a very small team.” But I look at that and I look at what’s happened and he turned out to be a disaster. This stuff happens.

You know, look, I’m not happy with the Supreme Court. They love to rule against me. I picked three people. I fought like hell for them. One in particular, I fought. They all said, “Sir, cut him loose.” He’s killing the senators. You know, very loyal senators, they’re very loyal people, “Sir, cut him loose, he’s killing us, sir, cut him loose.” I must have gotten half of the senators.

I said: “No, I can’t do that, it’s unfair to him and it’s unfair to the family. He didn’t do anything wrong.” They made up stories, they’re all made-up stories. He didn’t do anything wrong. “Cut him loose, sir.” I said, “No, I won’t do that. We got him through.” And you know what, they couldn’t give a damn. They couldn’t give a damn. Let him rule the right way.

But it almost seems that they’re all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country. To hurt our country.

You know, I read a story in one of the newspapers recently how I control the three Supreme Court justices. I control them. They’re puppets.

I read it about Bill Barr, that he’s my personal attorney. That he’ll do anything for me. And I said, “You know, it really is genius.” Because what they do is that, and it makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory, because all of a sudden Bill Barr changed. If you hadn’t noticed. I like Bill Barr, but he changed, because he didn’t want to be considered my personal attorney.

And the Supreme Court, they rule against me so much. You know why? Because the story is — I haven’t spoken to any of them, any of them, since virtually they got in — but the story is that they’re my puppets. Right? That they’re puppets.

And now the only way they can get out of that because they hate that it’s not good in the social circuit. And the only way they get out is to rule against Trump. So let’s rule against Trump. And they do that. So I want to congratulate them.

But it shows you the media’s genius. In fact, probably if I was the media, I’d do it the same way. I hate to say it. But we got to get them straightened out.

Today, for the sake of our democracy, for the sake of our Constitution, and for the sake of our children, we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You want to hear it?

(Audience responds: “Yeah”)

In every single swing state, local officials, state officials, almost all Democrats, made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures.

That these changes paved a way for fraud on a scale never seen before. I think we go a long way outside of our country when I say that.

So, just in a nutshell, you can’t make a change or voting for a federal election unless the state legislature approves it. No judge can do it. Nobody can do it. Only a legislature.

So as an example, in Pennsylvania, or whatever, you have a Republican legislature, you have a Democrat mayor, and you have a lot of Democrats all over the place. They go to the legislature. The legislature laughs at them, says we’re not going to do that. They say, thank you very much and they go and make the changes themselves, they do it anyway. And that’s totally illegal. That’s totally illegal. You can’t do that.

In Pennsylvania, the Democrat secretary of state and the Democrat state Supreme Court justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements just 11 days prior to the election.

So think of what they did. No longer is there signature verification. Oh, that’s OK. We want voter ID by the way. But no longer is there a signature verification. Eleven days before the election they say we don’t want it. You know why they don’t want to? Because they want to cheat. That’s the only reason.

Who would even think of that? We don’t want to verify a signature?

There were over 205,000 more ballots counted in Pennsylvania. Think of this, you had 205,000 more ballots than you had voters. That means you had two. Where did they come from? You know where they came from? Somebody’s imagination, whatever they needed.

So in Pennsylvania, you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters. And the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of a week ago. And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it’s a total fraud.

So Pennsylvania was defrauded. Over 8,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead people, lots of dead people, thousands. And some dead people actually requested an application. That bothers me even more.

Not only are they voting, they want an application to vote. One of them was 29 years ago, died. It’s incredible. Over 14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters, so these are voters that don’t live in this state.

And by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome-determinative, meaning these numbers far surpass. I lost by a very little bit. These numbers are massive, massive.

More than 10,000 votes in Pennsylvania were illegally counted, even though they were received after Election Day. In other words, they were received after Election Day. Let’s count them anyway.

And what they did in many cases is, they did fraud. They took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after Election Day. And more than 60,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were reported received back. They got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it, which is also logically and logistically impossible, right?

Think of that one. You got the ballot back. Let’s send the ballots. Oh, they’ve already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I don’t think that’s too good, right?

Twenty-five thousand ballots in Pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents, all in a single giant batch, not legal, indicating an enormous, illegal ballot harvesting operation. You’re not allowed to do it, it’s against the law.

The day before the election, the state of Pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out. Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400,000 people. It was increased, nobody knows where it came from, by 400,000 ballots, one day after the election.

It remains totally unexplained. They said, “Well, ah, we can’t figure that.” Now, that’s many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that one element. Four hundred thousand ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election.

By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn’t know because it was so quick. They had a vote. They voted. But now they see all this stuff, it’s all come to light. Doesn’t happen that fast. And they want to recertify their votes. They want to recertify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back. Mike Pence has to agree to send it back.

(Audience chants: “Send it back.”)

And many people in Congress want it sent back.

And think of what you’re doing. Let’s say you don’t do it. Somebody says, “Well, we have to obey the Constitution."" And you are, because you’re protecting our country and you’re protecting the Constitution. So you are.

But think of what happens. Let’s say they’re stiffs and they’re stupid people, and they say, well, we really have no choice. Even though Pennsylvania and other states want to redo their votes. They want to see the numbers. They already have the numbers. Go very quickly. And they want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken, as I said, because it wasn’t approved by their legislature. You know, that, in itself, is legal. And then you have the scam, and that’s all of the things that we’re talking about.

But think of this. If you don’t do that, that means you will have a president of the United States for four years, with his wonderful son. You will have a president who lost all of these states. Or you will have a president, to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states.

You will have an illegitimate president. That’s what you’ll have. And we can’t let that happen.

These are the facts that you won’t hear from the fake news media. It’s all part of the suppression effort. They don’t want to talk about it. They don’t want to talk about it. In fact, when I started talking about that, I guarantee you, a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off. And that’s a lot of cameras back there. But a lot of them went off.

But these are the things you don’t hear about. You don’t hear what you just heard. I’m going to go over a few more states. But you don’t hear it by the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you. Big tech, media.

Just like the suppression polls that said we’re going lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Well, we won Wisconsin. They don’t have it that way because they lost just by a little sliver. But they had me down the day before, Washington Post/ABC poll, down 17 points.

I called up a real pollster. I said, “What is that?” “Sir, that’s called a suppression poll. I think you’re going to win Wisconsin, sir.”

I said, “But why don’t they make it four or five points?” Because then people vote. But when you’re down 17, they say, “Hey, I’m not going to waste my time. I love the president, but there’s no way.”

Despite that, despite that, we won Wisconsin. It’s going to see. I mean, you’ll see. But that’s called suppression because a lot of people when they see that. It’s very interesting. This pollster said, “Sir, if you’re down three, four, or five people vote. When you go down 17, they say, ‘Let’s save. Let’s go and have dinner and let’s watch the presidential defeat tonight on television, darling.’”

And just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media. Every time I put out a tweet, that’s, even if it’s totally correct, totally correct, I get a flag. I get a flag.

And they also don’t let you get out. You know, on Twitter, it’s very hard to come onto my account. It’s very hard to get out a message. They don’t let the message get out nearly like they should. But I’ve had many people say, “I can’t get on your Twitter.” I don’t care about Twitter. Twitter’s bad news. They’re all bad news.

But you know what, if you want to, if you want to get out a message and if you want to go through Big tech, social media, they are really, if you’re a conservative, if you’re a Republican, if you have a big voice, I guess they call it shadow banned, right? Shadow banned. They shadow ban you, and it should be illegal.

I’ve been telling these Republicans, get rid of Section 230. And for some reason, Mitch and the group, they don’t want to put it in there and they don’t realize that that’s going to be the end of the Republican Party as we know it, but it’s never going to be the end of us. Never. Let them get out. Let, let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength.

They also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that aren’t so. They want to indoctrinate your children. It’s all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy, and the American people are finally standing up and saying no. This crowd is, again, a testament to it.

I did no advertising, I did nothing. You do have some groups that are big supporters. I want to thank that, Amy, and everybody. We have some incredible supporters, incredible. But we didn’t do anything. This just happened. Two months ago, we had a massive crowd come down to Washington. I said, “What are they there for?” “Sir, they’re there for you.”

We have nothing to do with it. These groups are for, they’re forming all over the United States. And we got to remember, in a year from now, you’re going to start working on Congress and we got to get rid of the weak Congress, people, the ones that aren’t any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world. We got to get rid of them. We got to get rid.

You know, she never wants a soldier brought home, I brought a lot of our soldiers home. I don’t know, somewhat like it. They’re in countries that nobody even knows the name, nobody knows where they are. They’re dying. They’re great, but they’re dying. They’re losing their arms, their legs, their face. I brought them back home, largely back home. Afghanistan, Iraq.

Remember, I used to say in the old days: “Don’t go in Iraq. But if you go in, keep the oil.” We didn’t keep the oil. So stupid. So stupid these people. And Iraq has billions and billions of dollars now in the bank. And what did we do? We got nothing. We never get. But we do actually, we kept the oil here or we get, we did good.

We got rid of the ISIS caliphate. We got rid of plenty of different things that everybody knows and the rebuilding of our military in three years. People said it couldn’t be done. And it was all made in the USA, all made in the USA, best equipment in the world.

In Wisconsin, corrupt Democrat-run cities deployed more than 500 illegal, unmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of 91,000 unlawful votes. It was razor-thin, the loss. This one thing alone is much more than we would need. But there are many things.

They have these lockboxes. And, you know, they’d pick them up and they disappear for two days. People would say where’s that box? They disappeared. Nobody even knew where the hell it was.

In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted in Wisconsin without a valid absentee ballot application. So they had a vote, but they had no application, and that’s illegal in Wisconsin. Meaning those votes were blatantly done in opposition to state law and they came 100% from Democrat areas such as Milwaukee and Madison, 100%.

In Madison, 17,000 votes were deposited in so-called human drop boxes. You know what that is, right? Where operatives stuff thousands of unsecured ballots into duffle bags on park benches across the city, in complete defiance of cease-and-desist letters from state legislature.

Your state legislatures said don’t do it. They’re the only ones that can approve it. They gave tens of thousands of votes. They came in in duffle bags. Where the hell did they come from?

According to eyewitness testimony, Postal Service workers in Wisconsin were also instructed to illegally backdate approximately 100,000 ballots. The margin of difference in Wisconsin was less than 20,000 votes. Each one of these things alone wins us the state. Great state. We love the state. We won the state.

In Georgia, your secretary of state who, I can’t believe this guy’s a Republican. He loves recording telephone conversations. You know, that was? I thought it was a great conversation personally. So did a lot of other. People love that conversation because it says what’s going on.

These people are crooked. They’re 100%, in my opinion, one of the most corrupt, between your governor and your secretary of state. And now you have it again last night. Just take a look at what happened. What a mess.

And the Democrat Party operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitution — unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures.

Stacey Abrams. She took them to lunch. And I beat her two years ago with a bad candidate, Brian Kemp. But they took, the Democrats took the Republicans to lunch because the secretary of state had no clue what the hell was happening. Unless he did have a clue. That’s interesting. Maybe he was with the other side.

But we’ve been trying to get verifications of signatures in Fulton County, they won’t let us do it. The only reason they won’t is because we’ll find things in the hundreds of thousands. Why wouldn’t they let us verify signatures in Fulton County, which is known for being very corrupt. They won’t do it. They go to some other county where you would live.

I said, “That’s not the problem.” The problem is Fulton County, home of Stacey Abrams. She did a good job, I congratulate her. But it was done in such a way that we can’t let this stuff happen. We won’t have a country if it happens.

As a result, Georgia’s absentee ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off.

Forty-eight counties in Georgia, with thousands and thousands of votes, rejected zero ballots. There wasn’t one ballot. In other words, in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before, and more people were voting by mail for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before.

The only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally. That’s the only way you could explain it.

By the way, you’re talking about tens of thousands. If Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years, they should have been approximately 45,000 ballots rejected. Far more than what we needed to win, just over 11,000. They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that. Just over 11,000 votes, that’s all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we’re not going to forget it.

There’s only one reason the Democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching, opposed voter ID, and stop citizenship confirmation. “Are you a citizenship?” You’re not allowed to ask that question, because they want to steal the election.

The radical left knows exactly what they’re doing. They’re ruthless and it’s time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories.

In Fulton County, Republican poll watchers were ejected, in some cases, physically from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst. Water main burst, everybody leave. Which we now know was a total lie.

Then election officials pull boxes, Democrats, and suitcases of ballots out from under a table. You all saw it on television, totally fraudulent. And illegally scanned them for nearly two hours, totally unsupervised. Tens of thousands of votes. This act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000 votes for Joe Biden, almost none for Trump. Oh, that sounds fair. That was at 1:34 a.m.

The Georgia secretary of state and pathetic governor of Georgia, have reached, although he says I’m a great president. You know, I sort of maybe have to change. He said the other day, “Yes, I do. I disagree with president, but he’s been a great president.” Good, thanks. Thank you very much.

Because of him and others, you have Brian Kemp. Vote him the hell out of office, please. Well, his rates are so low. You know, his approval rating now, I think it just reached a record low.

They’ve rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in Fulton County. Even without an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we’ve identified across the state is staggering.

Over 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election.

More than 2,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison. People who are not allowed to vote.

More than 4,500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state’s own voter rolls.

Over 18,000 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant, according to the Postal Service.

At least 88,000 ballots in Georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated.

Sixty-six thousand votes, each one of these is far more than we need. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.

And at least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to November 3 election. They say they moved right back. They moved right back. Oh, they moved out, they moved right back. OK. They missed Georgia that much. I do. I love Georgia, but it’s a corrupt system.

Despite all of this, the margin in Georgia is only 11,779 votes.

Each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in Georgia, a big beautiful victory. Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me and from the country.

And not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified.

In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. Two thousand ballots were returned with no address. More than 22,000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out. They returned, but we haven’t mailed them yet.

Eleven thousand six hundred more ballots and votes were counted, more than there were actual voters. You see that? So you have more votes again than you have voters.

One hundred and fifty thousand people registered in Maricopa County after the registration deadline. One hundred and three thousand ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no Republican observers.

In Clark County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000 ballots.

If you signed your name as Santa Claus, it would go through.

There were also more than 42,000 double votes in Nevada. Over 150,000 people were hurt so badly by what took place. And 1,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Nevada residents who died in 2020 prior to November 3 election. More than 8,000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didn’t live there.

The margin in Nevada is down at a very low number, any of these things would have taken care of the situation. We would have won Nevada, also. Every one of these we’re going over, we win.

In Michigan, quickly, the secretary of state, a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications sent to every person on the rolls in direct violation of state law.

More than 17,000 Michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match people who were deceased.

In Wayne County, that’s a great one. That’s Detroit. One hundred and seventy-four thousand ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter. Nobody knows where they came from.

Also, in Wayne County, poll watchers observed canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to three or four or five times.

In Detroit, turnout was 139% of registered voters. Think of that. So you had 139% of the people in Detroit voting. This is in Michigan. Detroit, Michigan.

A career employee of the Detroit, City of Detroit, testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight Democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted for. When a Republican came in, they wouldn’t talk to him.

The same worker was instructed not to ask for any voter ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were Democrats. She also told to illegally, and was told, backdate ballots received after the deadline and reports that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated. That’s Michigan.

Four witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in Detroit announced the last votes had been counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes. Every single one was for a Democrat. I got no votes.

At 6:31 a.m. in the early morning hours after voting had ended, Michigan suddenly reported 147,000 votes. An astounding 94% went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Only a couple of percentage points went to Trump.

Such gigantic and one-sided vote dumps were only observed in a few swing states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary.

You know what’s interesting? President Obama beat Biden in every state other than the swing states where Biden killed them, but the swing states were the ones that mattered.

They’re always just enough to push Joe Biden barely into the lead. We were ahead by a lot and within a number of hours we were losing by a little.

In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems. In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country.

Senator William Ligon, a great gentleman, chairman of Georgia’s senate judiciary subcommittee. Senator Ligon, highly respected, on elections has written a letter describing his concerns with Dominion in Georgia.

He wrote, and I quote, The Dominion Voting Machines employed in Fulton County had an astronomical and astounding 93.67% error rate. It’s only wrong 93% of the time in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter’s interest in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000.

Think of it. You go in and you vote and then they tell people who you supposed to be voting for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody’s ever even heard.

They adjudicate your vote. They say, Well, we don’t think Trump wants to vote for Trump. We think he wants to vote for Biden. Put it down for Biden.

The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1% and yet you’re at 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or destroyed to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter.

The letter continues. There is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties in Georgia.

For example, in Bibb County, President Trump was reported to have 29,391 votes at 9:11 p.m. Eastern time, while simultaneously Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,213. Minutes later, just minutes, at the next update, these vote numbers switched with President Trump going way down to 17,000 and Biden going way up to 29,391. And that was very quick, a 12,000 vote switch all in Mr. Biden’s favor.

So, I mean, I could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state, and all of these legislatures want this back. I don’t want to do it to you because I love you and it’s freezing out here. But I could just go on forever. I can tell you this.

(Audience chants: “We love you.”)

So when you hear, when you hear, while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing, this is the most fraudulent thing anybody has, this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise. And the press will say, and I’m sure they won’t put any of that on there, because that’s no good. And you ever see, while there is no evidence to back President Trump’s assertion.

I could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it. There’s never been anything like it.

Think about it. Detroit had more votes than it had voters. Pennsylvania had 205,000 more votes than it had more. But you don’t have to go any. Between that, I think that’s almost better than dead people if you think, right? More votes than they had voters. And many other states also.

It’s a disgrace that the United States of America, tens of millions of people, are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification.

In no state is there any question or effort made to verify the identity, citizenship, residency or eligibility of the votes cast.

The Republicans have to get tougher. You’re not going to have a Republican Party if you don’t get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so, sir, yes, the United States. The Constitution doesn’t allow me to send them back to the States. Well, I say, yes it does, because the Constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our Constitution, and you can’t vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, doesn’t it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you’re allowed to go by very different rules.

So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he’s listening to.

It is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed full of non-citizens, felons and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote. Yet Democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls. They don’t want to clean them up. They’re loaded.

And how many people here know other people, that when there are hundreds of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out, got three, four, five, six, and I heard one, who got seven ballots. And then they say you didn’t quite make it, sir.

We won in a landslide. This was a landslide. They said it’s not American to challenge the election. This the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world.

You know, you could go third-world countries, but I don’t think they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they don’t have voters for them. I mean no matter where you go, nobody would think this.

In fact, it’s so egregious, it’s so bad that a lot of people don’t even believe it. It’s so crazy that people don’t even believe it. It can’t be true. So they don’t believe it.

This is not just a matter of domestic politics, this is a matter of national security.

So today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I’m calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left.

Today is not the end, it’s just the beginning.

With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that.

I say that over and over, and I never get challenged by the fakeness, and they challenge almost everything we say.

But our fight against the big donors, big media, big tech, and others is just getting started. This is the greatest in history. There’s never been a movement like that.

You look back there all the way to the Washington Monument. It’s hard to believe.

We must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again, can never be allowed to happen again.

But we’re going forward. We’ll take care of going forward. We’ve got to take care of going back. Don’t let them talk. OK, well, we promised. I’ve had a lot of people. Sir, you’re at 96% for four years. I said I’m not interested right now. I’m interested in right there.

With your help, we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter ID. You need an ID to cash a check. You need an ID to go to a bank, to buy alcohol, to drive a car. Every person should need to show an ID in order to cast your most important thing, a vote.

We will also require proof of American citizenship in order to vote in American elections. We just had a good victory in court on that one, actually.

We will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud. These drop boxes are fraudulent. Therefore, they get disapp — they disappear, and then all of a sudden they show up. It’s fraudulent.

We will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting.

We will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner.

We will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on Election Day so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice.

We will finally hold big tech accountable. And if these people had courage and guts, they would get rid of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in America, in the world has.

All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections, and it has to be stopped. And the Republicans have to get a lot tougher, and so should the Democrats. They should be regulated, investigated, and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law. They’re totally breaking the law.

Together, we will drain the Washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nation’s capital. We have done a big job on it, but you think it’s easy. It’s a dirty business. It’s a dirty business. You have a lot of bad people out there.

Despite everything we’ve been through, looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds. Although this, I think, is our all-time record. I think you have 250,000 people. 250,000.

Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation’s future. Well, I have to say, we have to be a little bit careful. That’s a nice statement, but we have to be a little careful with that statement.

If we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because it’s illegal when the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information.

We are the greatest country on Earth and we are headed and were headed in the right direction.

You know, the wall is built. We’re doing record numbers at the wall. Now, they want to take down the wall. Let’s let everyone flow in. Let’s let everybody flow in. We did a great job in the wall. Remember, the wall, they said it could never be done. One of the largest infrastructure projects we’ve ever had in this country, and it’s had a tremendous impact, that we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of all of this stuff that we had to live with.

But now, the caravans, I think Biden’s getting in, the caravans are forming again. They want to come in again and rip off our country. Can’t let it happen.

As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side. We have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts. We love our country.

We have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls. Together, we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people.

Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements, still away.

I think one of our great achievements will be election security. Because nobody until I came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were.

And again, most people would stand there at 9 o’clock in the evening and say I want to thank you very much, and they go off to some other life. But I said something’s wrong here, something is really wrong, can have happened.

And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.

Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country.

And I say this despite all that’s happened. The best is yet to come.

So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we’re going to the Capitol, and we’re going to try and give.

The Democrats are hopeless, they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don’t need any of our help. We’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.

So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.

I want to thank you all. God bless you and God Bless America.

Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you."	-15.18

"On May 28, 1861, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney directly challenged President Abraham Lincoln’s wartime suspension of the great writ of habeas corpus, in a national constitutional showdown.

Lincon and Taney had not been on good terms prior to Taney’s decision on the habeas question in Ex Parte Merryman, which he issued while acting as a circuit judge. Taney had also written the majority opinion in the controversial Dred Scott case in 1857, a decision than Lincoln publicly criticized in his famous debates with Stephen Douglas. Lincoln also made the Dred Scott decision a central theme of his 1860 presidential campaign.

As Chief Justice, Taney was forced to issue the presidential oath to Lincoln in March 1861, and to listen to Lincoln’s inaugural address, where he again criticized Taney and the Dred Scott decision, but not directly by name.

“The candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal,” Lincoln said.

About three months later, Taney had his chance to address Lincoln’s vision of executive power in Ex Parte Merryman.

Article 1, Section 9, of the Constitution states that “the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” The Great Writ’s origins go back to the signing of the Magna Carta in England in 1215 and the writ compels the government to show cause to a judge for the arrest or detention of a person.

After the start of the Civil War, President Lincoln ordered General Winfield Scott to suspend habeas corpus near railroad lines that connected Philadelphia to Washington, amid fears of a rebellion in Maryland that would endanger Washington.

On May 25, 1861, federal troops arrested a Maryland planter, John Merryman, on suspicion that he was involved in a conspiracy as part of an armed secessionist group. Merryman was detained at Fort McHenry without a warrant. Merryman’s attorney petitioned the U.S. Circuit Court for Maryland, which Taney oversaw, for his client’s release.

On May 26, Taney issued a writ of habeas corpus and ordered General George Cadwalader, Fort McHenry’s commander, to appear in the circuit courtroom along with Merryman and to explain his reasons for detaining Merryman.

Cadwalader didn’t comply with the writ and instead sent a letter back to Taney on May 27 explaining that Lincoln had authorized military officers to suspend the writ when they felt there were public safety concerns. Taney then tried to notify Cadwalader that he was in contempt of court, but soldiers at Fort McHenry refused the notice.

On May 28, Taney issued an oral opinion, which was followed by a written opinion a few days later. He stated that the Constitution clearly intended for Congress, and not the President, to have to power to suspend the writ during emergencies.

“The clause in the Constitution which authorizes the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is in the ninth section of the first article. This article is devoted to the Legislative Department of the United States, and has not the slightest reference to the Executive Department,” Taney argued. “I can see no ground whatever for supposing that the President in any emergency or in any state of things can authorize the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or arrest a citizen except in aid of the judicial power,” Taney concluded.

However, Taney noted that he didn’t have the physical power to enforce the writ in this case because of the nature of the conflict at hand. “I have exercised all the power which the Constitution and laws confer on me, but that power has been resisted by a force too strong for me to overcome,” he said. But Taney did order that a copy of his opinion be sent directly to President Lincoln.

Lincoln didn’t respond directly or immediately to the Ex Parte Merryman decision. Instead, he waited until a July 4th address to confront Taney at a special session of Congress.

“Soon after the first call for militia it was considered a duty to authorize the Commanding General in proper cases, according to his discretion, to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or, in other words, to arrest and detain without resort to the ordinary processes and forms of law such individuals as he might deem dangerous to the public safety,” Lincoln said. “This authority has purposely been exercised but very sparingly.”

Lincoln then presented his famous response to Taney. “Are all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the Government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated? Even in such a case, would not the official oath be broken if the Government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it?”

The President also confronted Taney’s opinion that only Congress could suspend the writ.

“Now it is insisted that Congress, and not the Executive, is vested with this power; but the Constitution itself is silent as to which or who is to exercise the power; and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it can not be believed the framers of the instrument intended that in every case the danger should run its course until Congress could be called together, the very assembling of which might be prevented, as was intended in this case, by the rebellion,” Lincoln argued.

After the Merryman incident, Lincoln suspended the writ in other situations, and he received approval from Congress in March 1863 to suspend the writ for the duration of the conflict when “the public safety may require it.”"	-15.18
"Lincoln called Congress into special session, and, in a special message, he reported his actions since the Sumter attack. In the passage below, Lincoln defends himself against Taney’s charge that he violated the Constitution. Lincoln makes two arguments, that the Constitution must have provided for occasions when Congress was out of session, and the president’s oath of office authorizes the president to violate one law in order to preserve all of the laws.

After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, Lincoln took measures aimed at a military response including calling forth militia, blockading Confederate ports, and adding to the Army and Navy. Lincoln also authorized the suspension of habeas corpus in Maryland along train lines connecting Washington to Philadelphia. In Ex parte Merryman (1861), Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled in a circuit court that Lincoln lacked the power to suspend habeas corpus because the power could only be exercised by Congress. For Taney, the location of the Suspension Clause in Article One of the Constitution signified that the power was meant to be legislative not executive.

Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:

. . . It is thus seen that the assault upon, and reduction of, Fort Sumter, was, in no sense, a matter of self defense on the part of the assailants. They well knew that the garrison in the Fort could, by no possibility, commit aggression upon them. They knew – they were expressly notified – that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison, was all which would on that occasion be attempted, unless themselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more. They knew that this desired to keep the garrison in the Fort, not to assail them, but merely to maintain visible possession, and thus to preserve the Union from actual, and immediate dissolution – trusting, as herein-before stated, to time, discussion, and the ballot-box, for final adjustment; and they assailed, and reduced the Fort, for precisely the reverse object – to drive out the visible authority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to immediate dissolution.

That this was their object, the Executive well understood; and having said to them in the inaugural address, “You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors,”[1] he took pains, not only to keep this declaration good, but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry, as that the world should not be able to misunderstand it. By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances, that point was reached. Then, and thereby, the assailants of the government, began the conflict of arms, without a gun in sight, or in expectancy, to return their fire, save only the few in the Fort, sent to the harbor, years before, for their own protection and still ready to give that protection, in whatever was lawful. In this act, discarding all else, they have forced upon the country, the distinct issue: “immediate dissolution, or blood.”

And this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States. It presents to the whole family of man, the question, whether a constitutional republic, or a democracy – a government of the people, by the same people – can, or cannot, maintain its territorial integrity, against its own domestic foes. It presents the question, whether discontented individuals, too few in numbers to control administration, according to organic law, in any case, can always, upon the pretense made in this case, or on any other pretenses, or arbitrarily, without any pretense, break up their government, and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth. It forces us to ask: “Is there, in all republics, this inherent, and fatal weakness?” “Must a government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?”

So viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government; and so to resist force, employed for its destruction, by force, for its preservation. . . .

Soon after the first call for militia, it was considered a duty to authorize the Commanding General, in proper cases, according to his discretion, to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus; or, in other words, to arrest, and detain, without resort to the ordinary processes and forms of law, such individuals as he might deem dangerous to the public safety. This authority has purposely been exercised but very sparingly. Nevertheless, the legality and propriety of what has been done under it, are questioned; and the attention of the country has been called to the proposition that one who is sworn to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” should not himself violate them. Of course, some consideration was given to the questions of power, and propriety, before this matter was acted upon. The whole of the laws which required to be faithfully executed, were being resisted, and failing of execution, in nearly one-third of the States. Must they be allowed to finally fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear, that by the use of the means necessary to their execution, some single law, made in such extreme tenderness of the citizen’s liberty, that practically, it relieves more of the guilty, than of the innocent, should, to a very limited extent, be violated? To state the question more directly, are all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated? Even in such a case, would not the official oath be broken, if the government should be overthrown, when it was believed that disregarding the single law, would tend to preserve it? But it was not believed that this question was presented. It was not believed that any law was violated. The provision of the Constitution that “The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,” is equivalent to a provision – is a provision – that such privilege may be suspended when, in cases of rebellion, or in invasion, the public safety does require it. It was decided that we have a case of rebellion, and that the public safety does require a qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which was authorized to be made. Now it is insisted that Congress, and not the Executive, is vested with this power. But the Constitution itself, is silent as to which, or who, is to exercise the power; and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be believed the framers of the instrument intended, that in every case, the danger should run its course, until Congress could be called together; the very assembling of which might be prevented, as was intended in this case, by the rebellion.

No more extended argument is now offered; as an option, at some length will probably be presented by the Attorney General. Whether there shall be any legislation upon the subject, and if any, what, is submitted entirely to the better judgement of Congress. . . ."	-15.18

"The Biden-Harris Administration will open a Special Enrollment Period for Americans to sign up for health coverage and roll back attacks on the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and access to reproductive health care

After four years of attempts to strip health care from millions of Americans, President Biden will sign two executive actions that will begin to restore and strengthen Americans’ access to quality, affordable health care. The Biden-Harris administration will re-open enrollment to the Health Insurance Marketplace, take additional steps to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, and protect women’s health. These actions demonstrate a strong commitment by the Biden-Harris Administration to protect and build on the Affordable Care Act, meet the health care needs created by the pandemic, reduce health care costs, protect access to reproductive health care, and make our health care system easier to navigate and more equitable.

For President Biden, this is personal. He believes that every American has a right to the peace of mind that comes with knowing they have access to affordable, quality health care. Because of the Affordable Care Act, over 100 million people no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have a pre-existing condition. Roughly 20 million additional Americans obtained the security that comes with health insurance, and young people transitioning from school to a job can stay covered by their parents’ plan until age 26.

As we continue to battle COVID-19, it is even more critical that Americans have meaningful access to affordable care. The actions the President is taking today complement the commitment he made in the American Rescue Plan to make health insurance coverage more affordable for millions of Americans. Reliable and affordable access to health insurance doesn’t just benefit families’ health; it is a critical source of economic security and peace of mind for all.

Today’s actions include:

Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. This Executive Order takes critical steps to reverse attacks on and strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, so they can continue to provide access to life-saving care for millions of Americans. Based on this Executive Order, it is expected that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will open HealthCare.gov for a “Special Enrollment Period,” from February 15, 2021 – May 15, 2021. This Special Enrollment Period will give Americans that need health care coverage during this global pandemic the opportunity to sign up.

The President will also direct federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access.

Agencies are directed to re-examine:

Policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19;

Demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements;

Policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance;

Policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and

Policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.

As part of their reviews, agencies will consider whether to take additional actions to strengthen and protect access to health care.

Protecting Women’s Health at Home and Abroad. Across the country and around the world, people — particularly women, Black, Indigenous and other people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and those with low incomes — have been denied access to reproductive health care. President Biden is also issuing a Presidential Memorandum to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care. The memorandum reflects the policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to support women’s and girls’ sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally. Like memoranda issued by President Clinton and President Obama before him, it immediately rescinds the global gag rule, also referred to as the Mexico City Policy, which bars international non-profits that provide abortion counseling or referrals from receiving U.S. funding. In recognition of the additional work necessary to protect access to reproductive health care, President Biden’s memorandum also directs the Department of Health and Human Services to take immediate action to consider whether to rescind regulations under its Title X family planning program.

"(CNN) President Joe Biden is reopening enrollment on the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges as part of two health care executive actions that he signed Thursday, taking a step to help uninsured Americans that former President Donald Trump rejected.

It's Biden's first move toward delivering on his campaign promise to bolster the landmark health reform law that he championed as vice president. And it comes as more Americans could be facing the loss of coverage because of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn.

""Today, I'm about to sign two executive orders that basically, the best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done,"" Biden said. ""There's nothing new that we are doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became president.""

Open enrollment on the federal exchanges, which the Trump administration cut in half to six weeks, ended on December 15. But Biden has the power to reopen sign-ups, which will allow the uninsured to select policies under a special enrollment period.

Biden's order calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to reopen enrollment on healthcare.gov, which serves 36 states, to those who need coverage from February 15 until May 15. The agency did so on Thursday.

""As we continue to battle Covid-19, it's even more critical that Americans have meaningful access to health care,"" Biden said.

Trump refused to take this step last year, despite heavy lobbying from elected officials of both parties and the health care industry. Eleven states that run their own Obamacare exchanges, along with the District of Columbia, allowed their uninsured residents to obtain coverage outside the usual time frame. Most, if not all, are also expected to reopen their enrollment, a White House official said.

Soon after the President signed the executive order, California announced it would open its exchange from February 1 to May 15.

Thursday's executive orders focus on health care. Biden also signed measures aimed at strengthening Medicaid, as well as rescinding the so-called Mexico City Policy -- which bans the US government from funding foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions -- and reviewing the Title X abortion referral restrictions.

Biden has turned to executive actions in his first days in office to swiftly start putting in place his agenda and to wipe out that of his predecessor.

Reversing Trump administration directives

As part of Thursday's executive measures, Biden is directing federal agencies to reexamine a multitude of actions taken by his predecessor.

""He changed and made more inaccessible, more expensive and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two items, the Affordable Care Act or Medicaid,"" he continued.

These include policies that weaken protections for people with preexisting conditions and that undermine the Obamacare exchanges or other health insurance markets.

He also wants agencies to review measures that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and that reduce affordability or financial assistance, including for dependents.

And the President is asking agencies to look at Affordable Care Act and Medicaid waivers and demonstration projects that the Trump administration approved or put in place that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements.

The agencies will also consider whether additional actions are needed to strengthen and protect access to health care.

Augmenting the Affordable Care Act

Increasing the number of insured Americans by strengthening the Affordable Care Act was at the heart of Biden's health care campaign promises. However, his two main measures -- creating a government-run public option and increasing Obamacare's federal premium subsidies -- will require Congress and face plenty of opposition.

The President included a proposal to boost Affordable Care Act subsidies so that consumers don't pay more than 8.5% of their income for coverage in his $1.9 trillion relief package , which is already facing hurdles on Capitol Hill.

Reopening enrollment is a much easier lift, though it's unclear how much impact it will have.

Anyone who loses job-based health insurance coverage is already eligible to sign up on the exchanges within 60 days of becoming uninsured. Enrollment in the first five months of 2020 jumped 46% compared to the same period the year before, the Trump administration said in June.

Also, more people have appeared to hold on to job-based coverage than expected, while those who have lost their employment and most of their income have turned to Medicaid. Between February and August, Medicaid enrollment jumped by more than 5.8 million people, or 9.1%, according to federal data released in late December.

During the most recent open enrollment period, overall Obamacare sign-ups for 2021 coverage increased when comparing the 36 states participating on the federal exchange both this year and last year -- the only time that happened under Trump. But the number of new consumers for 2021 slid somewhat.

Nearly 9 uninsured million people could get free or subsidized bronze plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges during a special enrollment period, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released Wednesday. Bronze plans typically have lower premiums, but higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.

A total of about 15 million uninsured people could shop for coverage on the exchanges, Kaiser said.

Making the changes work

The key to reopening enrollment will be publicizing it and providing help for people to sign up, according to a recent Kaiser discussion with navigators who assist those looking for coverage on the exchanges. They also say the period should last more than six weeks.

The Trump administration slashed advertising by 90% and deeply cut funding for enrollment assistance -- two measures Biden is expected to reverse. Unspent revenue from exchange user fees appears to have accumulated to more than $1 billion over fiscal years 2018 to 2020, according to Kaiser.

Just over half of consumers who looked for coverage during the open enrollment period for 2020 coverage encountered difficulties, and nearly 5 million folks sought in-person help but couldn't get it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released Monday.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the federal exchange, said Thursday that it will spend $50 million on outreach and education, including advertisements on broadcast and digital platforms. The agency also will conduct an outreach campaign with community groups to raise awareness of the new opportunity to enroll in English, Spanish and other languages.

""The outreach budget for healthcare.gov was slashed dramatically during the prior administration,"" the White House official said. ""So folks who were uninsured weren't really given the opportunity to learn about the ability to get coverage. That's what we're aiming to rectify during this special enrollment period.""

Many health care moves expected

Thursday's measures will likely be the first of many efforts to bolster the Affordable Care Act and roll back Trump administration health care actions.

Among Biden's top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of Republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the Trump administration. It revolves around Congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid.

The case will continue even if the Justice Department under Biden withdraws, because it originated with Texas and other Republican-led states. But the President could work with the new Democratic majority in Congress to short circuit the GOP states' legal argument -- by setting the penalty at a $1, for instance.

Biden's executive measures will also likely lead to the reversal of various measures the Trump administration put in place to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. These include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing Georgia to stop using the federal exchange , healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.

Biden's health care officials are also expected to focus on Medicaid.

The Supreme Court recently agreed to consider the approval of work requirements in Arkansas and New Hampshire, which were voided by lower courts.

These measures run counter to Biden's promise to expand access to Medicaid so his administration will likely seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.

The Department of Health and Human Services is expected to take ""a very close look"" at the approvals involving work requirements, based on Thursday's executive order, the White House official said.

Also, Congress has limited states' ability to trim their Medicaid rolls during the public health emergency. The Biden administration may want to continue some of those provisions after it ends.

This story has been updated with additional developments."	-15.18
"The Biden administration plans to reopen enrollment in many of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, both to help those who may have lost health insurance during the pandemic and to offer coverage to those who did not have any and now want it. The move will be announced on Thursday as part of an executive order describing administration policies on shoring up health insurance coverage, according to three people familiar with the details.

The so-called special enrollment period is intended to help people who have lost coverage in the past year, but it will be open to those who want health insurance for any reason, in the 36 states that use Healthcare.gov. The decision was reported earlier by The Washington Post.

Typically, Americans without a special circumstance can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year’s coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. The Biden administration plans to have a large marketing campaign to announce the new opportunity and encourage people to enroll in health plans, two of the people said.

The insurance industry, which usually supports tight limits on insurance enrollments, is backing the extra enrollment period now. Around 15 million Americans are uninsured and eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most would qualify for some form of financial assistance if they bought such coverage — and about four million could sign up for a high-deductible plan that would cost them nothing in premiums."	-15.18
"A clampdown on political amplification: During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Zuckerberg called the decision “a continuation of work we’ve been doing for a while to turn down the temperature and discourage divisive conversations.”

The Facebook chief also said the company is considering taking new steps to limit the amount of political content users see in its News Feed.

“Politics has kind of had a way of creeping into everything, and I think lot of ... the feedback that we see from our community is that people don’t want that in their experience,” Zuckerberg said on the call with investors.

Under pressure: Tech companies are facing immense political scrutiny for the role social media platforms played in the insurrection at the Capitol.

Dozens of Democrats last week called on Facebook and other social media companies to overhaul their recommendations and algorithms to reduce the spread of incendiary, divisive and violent content on their platforms. The lawmakers railed against the companies, saying that by creating a “digital echo chamber,” they had contributed to the radicalization of those who stormed the Capitol.

""Perhaps no single entity is more responsible for the spread of dangerous conspiracy theories at scale or for inflaming anti-government grievance than the one that you started and that you oversee today as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,” they wrote in a letter to Zuckerberg.

The issue has also drawn bipartisan concern. A group of Senate Republicans and Democrats in 2019 teamed up on legislation to require platforms to give users the option of experiencing sites without algorithmic recommendations."	-15.18
"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday said the company will dial back on pushing political groups and content to users.

Why it matters: Facebook is hoping to dim intense political pressure from conservatives and liberals by backing away from arguments it’s long made that political speech is vital to free expression.

Details: On a call to investors, Zuckerberg said that the company will stop providing recommendations for users to join civic and political groups on a long-term basis.

The company had done so temporarily leading up to the U.S. election last year. Zuckerberg said Facebook plans to extend this policy globally as well.

Facebook also plans to take steps to reduce the amount of political content in the News Feed, although Zuckerberg didn't provide any details about how it plans to do so.

He said users don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience on the app.

What he's saying: ""There has been a trend across society that a lot of things have become politicized and politics have had a way of creeping into everything,"" Zuckerberg said. ""A lot of the feedback we see from our community is that people don't want that in their experience.""

""We have to balance this carefully because we do have deep commitment to free expression,"" he added. ""If people want to discuss [politics] or join those groups, they should be able to do that. But we are not serving community well to be recommending that content right now.""

Be smart: Inflammatory political speech on Facebook — and the company's handling of it — has been its biggest regulatory and reputational threat for years.

In recent months, the company has faced growing allegations from conservatives that it, along with some of its peers, intentionally censors their speech. Those claims have intensified since Facebook indefinitely suspended former President Trump following the Capitol riot.

Yes, but: It's unlikely the move will assuage critics on either side of the aisle.

Conservatives may see the algorithmic diminishing of politics as evidence Facebook is stifling views it doesn't like.

Liberals will likely say they're being punished for misdeeds from the far right. That complaint has been raised before, as when some tech firms paused all political donations after the Capitol riot and when Twitter dropped all political ads.

The big picture: The company has pushed to address political division on its platform by making tweaks to its algorithms to support verified news and to curb political advertising during times of political volatility."	-15.18
"Big Tech fed politics. Then it bled politics. Now it wants to be dead to politics.

Why it matters: The social platforms that profited massively on politics and free speech suddenly want a way out — or at least a way to hide until the heat cools.

Driving the news: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday said the company will stop providing recommendations for users to join civic and political groups on a long-term basis.

Facebook also plans to take steps to reduce the amount of political content in the News Feed, Zuckerberg said, although he didn't provide details about how it plans to do so.

""There has been a trend across society that a lot of things have become politicized and politics have had a way of creeping into everything. A lot of the feedback we see from our community is that people don't want that in their experience,"" he said.

Even the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropy organization run by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, appears to be shrinking back from politics.

It’s offloading most direct political advocacy work to outside groups, Recode reported Wednesday night, as part of an overhaul that will also see Zuckerberg and Chan spend $350 million to stand up a new group centered on criminal justice reform, a cause that has largely avoided being sucked into bitter partisan politics.

Be smart: In the long lead-up and then explosive aftermath of a volatile U.S. election, it has slowly dawned on platforms that political speech may be too tough for them to adequately police without themselves getting whacked politically.

Ads: Twitter, TikTok and others have all banned political ads from on the platform, while Facebook and Google have started to implement political ads limits around elections and sensitive events.

Twitter, TikTok and others have all banned political ads from on the platform, while Facebook and Google have started to implement political ads limits around elections and sensitive events. Speech: Most of the platforms have started taking much tougher stances on the type of speech they will tolerate from political leaders. Nearly every major Silicon Valley firm has either banned or restricted former President Donald Trump and some of his allies for hate speech or inciting violence.

PAC contributions: Following the Capitol siege earlier this month, most major tech firms said they would freeze political spending in an effort to avoid inadvertently funding members of Congress that voted not to certify the 2020 U.S. election results.

Between the lines: While many of these changes are meant to address regulatory pressure, they also address user demands to make their apps more friendly and less divisive.

A Pew Research Center survey in August found that 55% of U.S. social media users say they are ‘worn out’ by political posts and discussions.

A vast majority of users (70%) say it's “stressful and frustrating” to talk about politics on social media with people they disagree with, up from 59% in 2016.

Yes, but: Stepping away from politics is easier said than done.

The big picture: It will be nearly impossible for any of these platforms to completely ban political speech if they want to uphold the free-speech values that their entire business models are built on, and that they've spent years trumpeting.

Zuckerberg addressed that tension on Wednesday, saying:

""We have to balance this carefully because we do have deep commitment to free expression ... If people want to discuss [politics] or join those groups, they should be able to do that, but we are not serving community well to be recommending that content right now.""

The bottom line: Politics won’t be gone for good on these platforms, but they won’t be as prominent as they were leading up to the 2020 election."	-15.18
"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in a new interview says he'd seek court reform recommendations from a bipartisan commission if elected.

Biden made these comments in an interview set to air on 60 Minutes after facing questions in recent weeks about his position on the idea of packing the Supreme Court.

""If elected, what I will do is I'll put together a national commission, a bipartisan commission, of scholars, constitutional scholars — Democrats, Republicans, liberal, conservative — and I will ask them to, over 180 days, come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system, because it's getting out of whack the way in which it's being handled,"" Biden said.

Biden had been repeatedly asked whether he would support expanding the Supreme Court, a move some Democrats called for after Republicans announced they would move to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat before the election. In numerous interviews, Biden declined to specifically answer the question, although he recently said he's ""not a fan of court packing.""

In the 60 Minutes interview, Biden said he would look at his commission's recommendations and that they could involve several options outside of court packing.

""It's not about court packing, there's a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated,"" Biden said. ""And I'd look to see what recommendations that commission might make. ... There's a number of alternatives that go well beyond packing.""

Biden added that ""the last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want."" Brendan Morrow"	-15.18
"Fredrickson has hinted that she is intellectually supportive of ideas like court expansion. In 2019, she said in an interview with Eric Lesh, the executive director of the LGBT Bar Association and Foundation of Greater New York: “I often point out to people who aren't lawyers that the Supreme Court is not defined as ‘nine person body’ in the Constitution, and it has changed size many times.”

Rodríguez’s opinions on court reforms are less clear. Goldsmith’s selection, meanwhile, is likely to be the one to frustrate progressives. A senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Goldsmith did not support Trump and is a friend and co-author of Bauer. But he was a vocal advocate of Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the high court — an appointment that sparked Democratic advocacy for expanding the number of Supreme Court seats.

“He will also be an influential figure within the Supreme Court building,” Goldsmith wrote in 2018 about Kavanaugh in a Time article titled, “Brett Kavanaugh Will Right the Course of the Supreme Court.” “He is a brilliant analyst with a deep scholarly and practical knowledge of the law. His legal opinions are unusually accessible. He is a magnanimous soul.”

Bauer, who is not planning to go into the administration full-time, is himself a proponent of term limits for federal judges. He has been helping with the creation of the commission and, according to a person familiar with the deliberations, initially proposed the idea of forming a commission to study the issue of court reform.

“The President remains committed to an expert study of the role and debate over reform of the court and will have more to say in the coming weeks,"" a White House official said in a statement.

The recruitment of members is still ongoing, but a source familiar with the discussion expects between nine and 15 members total to be appointed to the commission. Rodríguez and Goldsmith did not respond to a request for comment, and Fredrickson declined to comment.

The idea for a commission came together amid the push by Republican senators to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in the weeks before the November election. Under intense pressure to consider reforms to the Supreme Court’s composition — including court expansion — Biden performed a classic Washington, D.C., punt. He announced in October that if he was elected, he would form such a commission to study structural changes. But Biden also conceded he is “not a fan of court packing.”

""The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want,"" Biden said in a “60 Minutes” interview in October. ""Presidents come and go. Supreme Court justices stay for generations.""

Progressive groups pushing for court expansion responded with skepticism to Biden’s announcement at the time. And they’ve remained skeptical to this day.

“Commissions are often places where ideas go to die and there is no time on the clock to reform the court,” said Aaron Belkin, the director of Take Back the Court, a progressive group advocating for adding seats to the Supreme Court. “The entire agenda of what needs to get done is in jeopardy thanks to stolen federal courts.”

“We know,” he added, “that court expansion is the only strategy to allow the administration to solve the problems facing the country.”

An administration official said the commission is part of a broader court review and reform effort, part of which will focus on lower courts.

Progressives’ push to expand the Supreme Court was reenergized after Democrats won both Georgia Senate runoff races in January, giving them control of the White House and Congress for the first time since 2010.

But any major structural reform would still be a heavy lift, as several Democratic senators have signaled their opposition to such measures. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday he was waiting for Biden’s commission to decide a path forward on reforms to the Supreme Court.

“President Biden has put together this commission to come up with a report in 180 days,” he said in an MSNBC interview this week. “We’re going to see what the commission says and go from there.”"	-15.18
"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's position on court packing is now absolutely clear: He does not want you to know his position.

""You'll know my position on court packing the day after the election,"" the former vice president told reporters on Thursday. His comments came a day after his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), avoided the question at the vice presidential debate.

Biden's stance is fundamentally undemocratic. No, it isn't as big a sin against American democracy as President Trump's accumulated offenses, but it is a problem. Biden is openly and intentionally depriving voters of critical information about an important issue — which means they are left to guess his intentions, and perhaps get a big surprise on November 4. That's not how the process should work.

But it is easier to try and win an election if you don't tell voters something they might not want to hear. And no matter what position Biden eventually takes on adding new justices to the Supreme Court — an action that would presumably give liberals a sudden advantage on the increasingly conservative court — he will alienate some of his prospective supporters. Court packing is popular with Democrats, but it isn't popular with voters more generally.

A new Washington Examiner/YouGov poll indicates that just 34 percent of independent voters — and 32 percent of independents — are in favor of adding justices to the court. That number zooms up to 60 percent for Democrats, however. That is no surprise. And presidential nominees often are challenged to find a balance between pleasing their party's voters while appealing to swing voters who might decide an election. The trick is not to make either side so unhappy that they decide not to cast a ballot.

Biden faces an additional challenge in 2020. He can't just win the election — he has to win big. If he wins the popular vote by a narrow margin, prognosticators believe Trump will win the Electoral College. A close election might also give Trump a chance to muddy the waters and claim victory for himself, no matter the actual vote tally. So Biden must build a coalition of voters so large that, if he wins, the repudiation of the current president is unmistakable both to Trump and his supporters.

So it is understandable that Biden doesn't want to reveal his plans for the court. That doesn't make it right.

Biden on Thursday said the media should focus instead on Trump's plans for the Supreme Court — and the GOP plan to get Amy Coney Barrett confirmed to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg either before Election Day, or at least by a potential Joe Biden inauguration in January. The court-packing question, he suggested, is a distraction.

""The moment I answer that question, the headline in every one of your papers will be about that rather than focusing on what's happening now,"" he said.

Barrett's nomination is a big, important issue. And the media isn't always great at walking and chewing gum at the same time. The problem, though, is that Biden's own plans for the court are inextricable from the current confirmation process. The ""merits of court packing literally depend on what happens on election day and whether the Republicans rush to confirm Barrett despite Trump losing,"" Lawfare's Susan Hennessey tweeted.

Biden is skeptical of court-packing, the thinking goes, so if Barrett's nomination fails and he gets to name Ginsburg's replacement, he might be able to resist Democratic pressure on the issue. But if Barrett is confirmed and Democrats win the presidency and the Senate, the left will campaign to ""rebalance"" the court so that conservative justices can't emasculate and derail progressive priorities that would otherwise come out of a Biden administration.

In other words, Biden's real position on court-packing is probably: ""It depends."" Why not say so? The question isn't going away, after all.

Democracy works best when voters know who and what they're voting for, and when elected officials can be accountable both for their promises and acts. American democracy, you may have noticed, has been a bit fragile of late. Ducking the issues that voters care about — and the court's composition is not a minor matter to be fudged — doesn't help. Rehabilitating our institutions almost certainly requires rebuilding the faith of a disillusioned citizenry. Biden can help that effort by being forthcoming about his plans for the Supreme Court.

"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the Federal Reserve will keep pursuing its low-interest rate policies until an economic recovery is well underway, acknowledging that the economy has faltered in recent months.

The Fed said in a statement after its latest policy meeting that hiring and economic growth had slowed, particularly in industries affected by the raging pandemic, notably restaurants, bars, hotels and others involving face-to-face public contact. The officials kept their benchmark short-term rate pegged near zero and said they would keep buying Treasury and mortgage bonds to restrain longer-term borrowing rates and support the economy.

Speaking at a news conference, Powell made clear his belief that the economy will struggle in the coming weeks and months, until widespread vaccinations and government rescue aid eventually fuel a sustained rebound.

“We’re a long way from full recovery,” he said. “Something like 9 million people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic. That’s as many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession.”

The Fed statement warned that the virus is posing risks to the economy. But the officials removed phrases from their previous statement in December that had said the pandemic was pressuring the economy in the “near term” and posed risks “over the medium term.”

Powell said that language was removed because the Fed policymakers see the pandemic increasingly as a short-term risk that will likely fade as vaccines are distributed more widely. But he also cautioned that the threat remains a serious one, particularly because of the potential harm from new strains of the virus.

“We have not won this yet,” Powell said. “There’s nothing more important to the economy now than people getting vaccinated.”

As Powell spoke, a broad sell-off on Wall Street knocked more than 600 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average, handing the stock market its worst day in nearly three months. The drop, which followed a recent record-setting run, came as investors focused on the uncertain outlook for the economy and corporate profits amid a still-raging coronavirus pandemic. Traders were also focused on the eye-popping surge in shares of GameStop , a money-losing video game seller that became the focus of a battle between small investors bidding it higher and big hedge funds betting it would fall.

For now, the job market is faltering, with 9.8 million jobs still lost to the pandemic, which erupted 10 months ago. Hiring has slowed for six straight months, and employers shed jobs in December for the first time since April. The job market has sputtered as the pandemic and colder weather have discouraged Americans from traveling, shopping, dining out or visiting entertainment venues. Retail sales have declined for three straight months.

Yet the Fed still envisions a sharp rebound in the second half of the year as the virus is brought under control by vaccines and government-enacted rescue money spreads through the economy. Americans fortunate enough to have kept their jobs have stockpiled massive savings that suggest pent-up demand that could be unleashed, with a big lift to the economy, once consumers increasingly feel safe about resuming their old spending patterns.

Powell was pressed during the news conference on whether the Fed should respond to the recent speculative surge in the prices of some individual stocks, notably shares of GameStop, and whether that buying frenzy suggested a dangerous bubble in overall stock prices. Powell deflected the questions by saying the Fed’s interest rate policies aren’t well-suited to address speculation in the stock market.

In addition, he said, “if you look at what’s really been driving asset prices in the last couple of months, it isn’t monetary policy. It’s expectations about vaccines and also fiscal policy. Those are the news items that have been driving asset values in recent months.”

Powell also noted that the Fed is keeping rates low and buying bonds to support economic growth. Reversing those policies to offset potential bubbles in the stock market, he said, could harm the economy.

“We don’t actually understand the trade-off,” he said. “Will it actually cause more damage, or will it help? I think that’s unresolved.”

The Fed has signaled that it expects to keep its key short-term rate at a record low between zero and 0.25% through at least 2023. Earlier this month, Vice Chair Richard Clarida said he expects the Fed’s bond purchases to extend through the end of this year, which would mean continued downward pressure on long-term loan rates.

The central bank said it will continue its bond purchases until it makes “substantial further progress” toward its goals of maximum employment and stable 2% inflation. Powell said “it is likely to take some time” for that progress to be achieved.

The Fed’s drive to keep long-term rates low have helped hold down mortgage rates and fueled home sales and price increases. Home prices, for example, surged 9% in November compared with a year earlier, its fastest increase in more than six years.

The prospect of significant more government rescue aid and ongoing vaccinations has raised some concern that as Americans eventually release pent-up demand for airline tickets, hotel rooms, new clothes and other goods and services, the economy might accelerate and annual inflation could surge above the Fed’s 2% target.

Full Coverage: Economy

If many companies don’t initially have the capacity to meet that demand, prices would pick up. Powell, however, dismissed those concerns, pointing to several long-run factors that have restrained inflation for more than a decade, such as an aging population that tends to spend less and save more, technological developments that improve efficiency, and overseas competition.

“Frankly, we welcome somewhat higher inflation,” Powell said. The Fed believes that inflation sustainably at 2% guards against deflation, a drop in prices and wages. And since interest rates include expected levels of inflation, that gives the Fed more room to cut interest rates. “The kind of troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems far away and unlikely.”

The Fed adopted a framework last year that calls for inflation to average 2% over time. Given that inflation has mostly languished below that level since the Fed adopted it as a target in 2012, policymakers would have to let inflation run above 2% for some time to make up for the years of below-target price increases."	-15.18

"Extremists Emboldened by Capitol Attack Pose Growing Threat, Homeland Security Says The department said publicly for the first time on Wednesday that the United States faced a growing threat from “violent domestic extremists” after the Capitol riot. The Biden administration plans to reopen enrollment in many Affordable Care Act marketplaces. This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the Biden presidency.

U.S. faces heightened threats from violent domestic extremists after Capitol attack, Homeland Security says. The breach of the Capitol might encourage domestic extremists to target other government facilities or elected officials, the Department of Homeland Security said. Credit... Oliver Contreras for The New York Times Warning that the deadly rampage at the Capitol this month may not be an isolated episode, the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday said publicly for the first time that the United States faced a growing threat from “violent domestic extremists” emboldened by the attack. The department’s terrorism alert did not name specific groups that might be behind any future attacks, but it made clear that their motivation would include anger over “the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives,” a clear reference to the accusations made by President Donald J. Trump and echoed by right-wing groups that the 2020 election was stolen. “D.H.S. is concerned these same drivers to violence will remain through early 2021,” the department said. The Department of Homeland Security does not have information indicating a “specific, credible plot,” according to a statement from the agency. The alert issued was categorized as one warning of developing trends in terrorism, rather than a notice of an imminent attack. But an intelligence official involved in drafting Wednesday’s bulletin said the decision to issue the report was driven by the department’s conclusion that Mr. Biden’s peaceful inauguration last week could create a false sense of security because “the intent to engage in violence has not gone away” among extremists angered by the outcome of the presidential election. The warning contained in a “National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin” was a notable departure for a Department of Homeland Security accused of being reluctant during the Trump administration to publish intelligence reports or public warnings about the dangers posed by domestic extremists and white supremacist groups for fear of angering Mr. Trump, according to current and former homeland security officials. Starting with the deadly extremist protest in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, when Mr. Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides,” he played down any danger posed by extremist groups. And when racial justice protests erupted nationwide last year, his consistent message was that it was the so-called radical left that was to blame for the violence and destruction that had punctuated the demonstrations. Even after the Department of Homeland Security in September 2019 singled out white supremacists as a leading domestic terrorism threat, analysts and intelligence officials said their warnings were watered down, delayed or both. Former officials in the Trump administration have even said that White House officials sought to suppress the phrase “domestic terrorism.” The intelligence official involved with the bulletin, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss its findings, added that the public warning should have been issued as early as November, when Mr. Trump was making an escalating series of false accusations about the election, and that far-right groups continued to be galvanized by such false statements. But at the time, Mr. Trump was also seeking to dismiss department officials whom he regarded as disloyal, including Christopher Krebs, the chief of its cybersecurity agency, after a committee overseeing the election declared it had been “the most secure in American history.” The agency failed to issue a warning to state and local agencies warning of specific violence aimed at the Capitol before the attack on Jan. 6.

Biden signs sweeping climate orders focusing on job creation and including a ‘pause’ in fossil fuel leasing.

Put climate change at the center of our domestic, national security and foreign policy. It’s advancing conservation, revitalizing communities and cities and on the on the farmlands, and securing environmental justice. Our plans are ambitious, but we are America.

On Wednesday, President Biden signed a series of executive orders aimed at combating climate change through job creation, and included a ‘pause’ in fossil fuel leasing. Credit Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President Biden on Wednesday signed a series of executive orders that aim to “confront the existential threat of climate change” across the federal government while emphasizing job creation and tackling racial inequity. “In my view, we’ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can’t wait any longer,” said Mr. Biden, speaking at the White House. “We see it with our own eyes. We feel it. We know it in our bones. And it’s time to act.” The president cast many of the executive orders as opportunities for job creation, among other things pledging to use the purchasing power of the federal government to buy a vast fleet of zero-emissions vehicles. “This will mean one million new jobs in the American automobile industry,” he said. Wednesday’s executive orders also set broad new foreign policy goals, including specifying that climate change, for the first time, will be a core part of all foreign policy and national security decisions. Mr. Biden’s international climate envoy, John Kerry, said earlier in the day that the United States would host an international climate change summit on Earth Day, April 22. “The convening of this summit is essential to ensuring that 2021 is going to be the year that really makes up for the lost time of the last four years,” said Mr. Kerry. He pledged that by that date he would announce a new set of specific targets detailing how the United States would lower its carbon dioxide emissions under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the international climate accord from which former President Donald J. Trump had withdrawn, and which Mr. Biden has rejoined. Gina McCarthy, the top adviser on domestic climate policy, said she intends to move forward quickly to implement new policies to cut emissions of greenhouse gases. “Here at home we have to do our part,” she said. Mr. Biden has already ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to begin the process of reinstating the federal government’s single largest policy to curb carbon dioxide emissions — an Obama-era rule that had been designed to cut greenhouse tailpipe pollution from automobile tailpipes, which Mr. Trump rolled back last year. Federal agencies also will be ordered to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies “and identify new opportunities to spur innovation.” Separately, Mr. Biden called on the campaign trail for overhauling tax breaks to oil companies — worth billions of dollars to the oil, coal and gas industries — to help pay for his $2 trillion climate change plan, although that plan is expected to face strong opposition in Congress.

Biden plans to reopen Obamacare exchanges in many states. President Biden spoke about his plans for the Affordable Care Act in November. Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times The Biden administration plans to reopen enrollment in many of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, both to help those who may have lost health insurance during the pandemic and to offer coverage to those who did not have any and now want it. The move will be announced on Thursday as part of an executive order describing administration policies on shoring up health insurance coverage, according to three people familiar with the details. The so-called special enrollment period is intended to help people who have lost coverage in the past year, but it will be open to those who want health insurance for any reason, in the 36 states that use Healthcare.gov. The decision was reported earlier by The Washington Post. Typically, Americans without a special circumstance can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year’s coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. The Biden administration plans to have a large marketing campaign to announce the new opportunity and encourage people to enroll in health plans, two of the people said. The insurance industry, which usually supports tight limits on insurance enrollments, is backing the extra enrollment period now. Around 15 million Americans are uninsured and eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most would qualify for some form of financial assistance if they bought such coverage — and about four million could sign up for a high-deductible plan that would cost them nothing in premiums. “For the four million people who could be getting free coverage who are instead uninsured — that, to me, is screaming out for outreach,” said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the foundation and a co-author of the analysis. It remains unclear how many people lost health insurance last year because of the pandemic, but most working-age Americans receive coverage through their employers, and millions have lost jobs. Enrollment in Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled, has grown substantially during the pandemic. And consumer advocates say there are also many Americans who were uninsured before but might want coverage now because of the public health crisis. Several states that run their own marketplaces established special enrollment periods last year and saw increased sign-ups.

The Biden administration is reviewing arms sales to the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia that were approved by Trump. The Trump administration’s deals with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia included the sales of advanced fighter jets and precision munitions. Credit... Wilson Ring/Associated Press The Biden administration is reviewing some weapons sales to Gulf Arab states approved by the Trump administration, including tens of billions of dollars of advanced fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates and precision munitions to Saudi Arabia. A State Department official speaking on background said on Wednesday that the administration was temporarily pausing some of the arms sales and transfers, calling the move a routine action typical of presidential transitions. But it drew unusual attention because the arms deals with the Gulf Arab nations, approved in the last months of the Trump administration, were the subject of intense political debate even before the review. Some Democrats expressed hope on Wednesday that the sales would be canceled, even as the administration downplayed the review. Democrats in Congress have strongly opposed the sales out of disgust over the Saudi and Emirati role in Yemen’s grueling civil war, which has inflicted vast civilian suffering, but they failed to attract enough Republican support to block the deals in Congress in December. Many Democrats began pressuring President Biden even before his inauguration to halt the sales. The deals in question include the $23 billion sale to the Emirates of 50 F-35 fighters and 18 Reaper drones, which President Donald J. Trump approved in the fall as an inducement for the Emirates to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel as part of the “Abraham Accords,” one of Mr. Trump’s proudest achievements. In late December, the State Department approved the sale of $478 million in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia, over the strong objections of Democrats, who said the bombs were sure to wind up killing innocent civilians in Yemen. Trump administration officials called that deal essential to supporting the Saudis in their fight against the Iranian-backed Houthis. Officials did not provide full details of all the agreements under review, but Mr. Trump approved the sale of billions of dollars of arms to the Saudis. A senior administration official said that the review does not include a freeze on the Emirati deal. A congressional official familiar with the review said that the Saudi arms shipments would be paused during the review. The news comes as many Democrats in Congress call for a reassessment of the United States’ relationship with the Gulf States, particularly Saudi Arabia. Mr. Trump and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, worked in virtual lock step with the Saudis and Emiratis. But Democrats say the war in Yemen and human rights issues, including the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, demand a more skeptical relationship.

Denis McDonough, Biden’s nominee for V.A. secretary, tells senators he’ll prioritize care access amid pandemic. Denis McDonough, President Biden’s nominee for secretary of veterans affairs, appeared before a Senate panel for his confirmation hearing on Wednesday. Credit... Sarah Silbiger/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images In remarks before the Senate Committee of Veterans Affairs on Wednesday, Denis McDonough, President Biden’s pick for secretary of veterans affairs, emphasized an agenda focused on guiding the department through the coronavirus pandemic and helping more veterans access care, assisting them with employment and reducing homelessness and suicide among veterans. Former President Donald J. Trump sought to greatly expand private care for veterans; critics of that expansion feared that it was an effort to starve the department of resources and reduce its care. Mr. McDonough was asked about the issue, which has been deeply politicized over the years, and he acknowledged that care access was a key concern for veterans. “If confirmed,” said Mr. McDonough, who once served as President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, “I will dedicate myself, with every fiber of my being, to fulfilling what President Biden rightly refers to as our country’s most sacred obligation: to prepare and equip our troops that we send in harm’s way, and to care for them and their families when they return.” The department over the years has endured a number of scandals over wait times for veteran care and other ethics issues. A $16 billion overhaul of the veterans medical records system was delayed last year amid technical and training glitches. And female veterans have repeatedly complained about sexual harassment and worse while seeking care at the department’s facilities. Mr. McDonough, like Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, said he would work to root out sexual harassment at his department “on day one.” “This won’t be easy,” he said. “The Department of Veterans Affairs faces great challenges, challenges made even more daunting by the coronavirus pandemic. Its capabilities have not always risen to the needs of our veterans.”

Pool photo by Michael Reynolds Linda Thomas-Greenfield, President Biden’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, on Wednesday called for America’s muscular return to the multilateral body to counter the rise of China during her confirmation hearing, while facing tough questions for her decision to deliver a speech two years ago at an institute that some have described as disseminating Chinese propaganda. Ms. Thomas-Greenfield gave the remarks in October 2019 at Savannah State University’s Confucius Institute, which has since closed. It was one of dozens of such entities around the country that offer Chinese-language classes, an operation that has drawn concerns about whether the Chinese Communist Party was using the centers to disseminate Chinese government propaganda on U.S. campuses. A number of Republican lawmakers sharply criticized Ms. Thomas-Greenfield’s speech to the institute as being overly optimistic about China’s relationship with African countries while not being tough enough on Beijing’s human rights record. Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said she had made a “huge mistake” speaking at a Confucius Institute, and that it did not constitute an accurate portrayal of her views on China. “I do regret that speech,” Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said. “But if you look at what I have done prior to that, there is no question that I am not at all naïve about what the Chinese are doing and I have called them out on a regular basis, including today.” Lawmakers’ concerns about the speech was earlier reported by The Washington Post. During her hearing, Ms. Thomas-Greenfield made sharp remarks about China’s human rights record, and said that the State Department was “reviewing” a determination made by the Trump administration declaring that the Chinese government was committing genocide and crimes against humanity through its repression of Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in its northwestern region of Xinjiang, because “all of the procedures were not followed.” She said that the situation in China was “horrific” and noted that she had “lived through, and experienced, and witnessed a genocide in Rwanda.” The situation in China, she said, “feels like that.” Ms. Thomas-Greenfield told the senators that if she was confirmed, the United States would become a more active presence at the United Nations, which saw diminished participation from the United States under President Donald J. Trump’s “America First” policy. A more prominent U.S. role, she said, would help stem China’s diplomatic advances on the global stage. Ms. Thomas-Greenfield’s nomination has been praised by veteran diplomats, who said her 35 years of experience as a foreign service officer would help rebuild America’s standing at the United Nations. Ms. Thomas-Greenfield entered the foreign service in 1982 and held a range of senior positions in the State Department. She served as U.S. ambassador to Liberia from 2008 to 2012 before moving on to become the director general of the foreign service for about a year. From 2013 to 2017, she served as the top U.S. diplomat for African affairs. In 2017, she was among a parade of diplomats who were pushed out of the department by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.

And we need only look around to see that. We at State have a role to play in all of this. And I believe it starts with rebuilding morale and trust. This is a priority for me because we need a strong department for the United States to be strong in the world. So we’ve got our work cut out for us, but I am confident we will succeed. The United States has enormous sources of strength we’re going to build upon. America’s values are noble and powerful, and we will recommit to them. And America’s leadership is needed around the world. And we’ll provide it because the world is far more likely to solve problems and meet challenges when the United States is there. America, at its best, still has a greater capacity than any other nation on earth to mobilize others for the better.” On Wednesday, the new secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, arrived at the State Department and laid out his plans. Credit Credit... Carlos Barria/Reuters On his first full day as secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken said that the State Department he would now lead was “not the same one that I left four years ago.” To illustrate his point, his remarks were delivered to a mostly-empty lobby at the department’s headquarters. The pomp of past arrival ceremonies for America’s top diplomat was dispensed with as a pandemic precaution. Instead, Mr. Blinken was greeted on Wednesday by a few dozen employees and journalists gathered to record his return to the department where he served as deputy secretary during the Obama administration. “We’ve never been in a moment quite like this before,” Mr. Blinken acknowledged in remarks that were broadcast online and on the State Department’s internal TV channel, for diplomats across the world to watch. “The world has changed,” he said. “The department has changed, and we need only look around to see that.” Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 0:45 - 0:00 transcript Harris Swears In Blinken as Secretary of State Vice President Kamala Harris delivered the oath of office to Antony J.

Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times He repeated his pledge to rebuild trust among State Department employees who he has said were demoralized during the Trump administration. He urged them to “speak up without fear or favor” when they disagree with policies. He also reminded the department’s staff of the longstanding tradition of putting “country over party.” That was a veiled contrast to the department under Mr. Blinken’s predecessor, Mike Pompeo, who openly embraced partisan politics during his tenure, including when he spoke at the Republican National Convention while on an official diplomatic trip to Jerusalem. Mr. Blinken also indirectly referred to the right-wing mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 — a culmination of years of national divisiveness that has left diplomats reeling over how to represent the United States abroad. “The world is watching us intently right now,” he said. “They want to know if we can heal our nation. They want to see whether we will lead with the power of our example, if we’ll put a premium on diplomacy with our allies and partners to meet the great challenges of our time.” He did not take questions at the end of his brief remarks, and headed to the White House about 90 minutes later for a ceremonial swearing-in by Vice President Kamala Harris.

Whitmer pleads with Michigan lawmakers to find common ground amid the pandemic. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan spoke to state lawmakers on Wednesday night in Lansing, in a virtual State of the State address seen here in a photograph provided by the governor’s office. Credit... Michigan Governors Office, via Associated Press Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan opened her annual State of the State speech on Wednesday by pleading with lawmakers to find common ground in fighting the staggering effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the state. “Based on the political environment this past year, you might think Republicans and Democrats in Lansing can’t find common ground on much of anything,” said Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat. She noted times when there had been bipartisan action in the Capitol. “Let’s tap into that same energy and end the pandemic, revitalize our economy and get our kids back in school.” But Republicans were having none of it. Hours before Ms. Whitmer gave her speech, Republicans in the State Senate refused to approve 13 appointments she had proposed for slots in state government, such as the leader of the Children’s Ombudsman Office, the Civil Rights Commission and members of agriculture boards. Republicans said they had rejected the appointments because they felt Ms. Whitmer was not including them enough in decision-making surrounding restrictions placed on businesses to stop the spread of Covid-19. “She has continued to circumvent the Legislature,” said State Sen. Aric Nesbitt, a Republican from Lawton. “I understand it’s not easy to compromise and try to work with 148 members of this Legislature. We have to use every tool available to compromise, and one of those tools is to not support her appointments.” Republicans in the State House of Representatives followed suit, offering a Covid relief plan that would withhold $2.1 billion in federal funding meant for schools to cope with the pandemic until Ms. Whitmer relinquished her authority to shut down in-person learning and sports during a health crisis. That power would shift to local health departments under the Republican plan. The public and pointed rejections of the governor’s appointments and authority came as the 2022 election cycle began ramping up. Ms. Whitmer is up for re-election in 2022, and no top-tier Republican has come forward to challenge her. Forced to speak remotely instead of in front of both chambers of the Legislature because of pandemic protocols, Ms. Whitmer offered plans to fix roads, provide extra hazard pay to teachers and allocate state resources to help residents who have lost their jobs during the pandemic find employment. But it was the coronavirus, which has infected more than 600,000 state residents and killed more than 15,000 since it was first reported in Michigan in March, that dominated her address. She said she planned to start a statewide tour to talk with Michiganders from all walks of life, Republicans and Democrats alike, to try and find common ground as the state emerges from the pandemic. The tour is designed “to focus on what unites us, improve how we talk to each other,” she said. “My mission is to find common ground so we can emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.”

McCarthy to meet Trump after rift over his assertion that the former president ‘bears responsibility’ for the Capitol attack. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, has faulted the former president for the assault on the Capitol this month. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times Donald J. Trump is set to meet on Thursday with Representative Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, weeks after Mr. Trump erupted over Mr. McCarthy saying on the House floor that the former president bore responsibility for the violent rampage at the Capitol on Jan. 6. The two are to meet at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s private club in Florida, according to a person briefed on the plan. Mr. McCarthy, Republican of California, was not making a special trip for the meeting; he was in Palm Beach, Fla., to raise money for the party’s efforts to try to retake the House majority in 2022, the person said. Mr. Trump had been livid with Mr. McCarthy and, according to people close to the former president, privately referred to him with a vulgarity commonly used to describe a coward after his speech during the House debate on impeaching the former president for “incitement of insurrection.” “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters,” Mr. McCarthy said in the speech, which he delivered before joining a vast majority of Republicans in opposing the charge. “He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding. These facts require immediate action by President Trump: accept his share of responsibility, quell the brewing unrest and ensure President-elect Biden is able to successfully begin his term.” Mr. Trump did none of those things, yet Mr. McCarthy has since tempered his criticism. He told reporters last week that he did not believe Mr. Trump had “provoked” the mob. In an interview that aired on Sunday, he said that while the former president bore “some responsibility” for the storming of the Capitol, “I also think everybody across this country has some responsibility.” Some Trump advisers have tried to tamp down the notion that Mr. Trump has lingering hostility toward the House leader, and aides to both men hoped the meeting would help ease tensions. It came amid mounting evidence that most Republicans — far from repudiating Mr. Trump, as it appeared they might after the deadly siege — have rallied strongly around him before his impeachment trial. All but five Senate Republicans voted on Tuesday to dismiss the trial as unconstitutional before it could get underway. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, joined a vast majority of his party in doing so, though he has said that he believes Mr. Trump “provoked” the mob that assaulted the Capitol and privately concluded that the former president committed impeachable offenses. Mr. McConnell, who had previously said he would wait to hear the arguments at trial before deciding whether to convict Mr. Trump, told reporters on Wednesday that he still had an open mind about a proceeding that has yet to begin in earnest. “I intend to participate in that and listen to the evidence,” he said. Mr. McConnell has not spoken to Mr. Trump since mid-December, when he called the White House to inform him that he planned to recognize President Biden’s victory after the Electoral College certification of the results.

Marjorie Taylor Greene reportedly endorsed executing Democrats on Facebook before she was elected to Congress. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican who was elected in November, has promoted QAnon and other conspiracy theories. Credit... Susan Walsh/Associated Press Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a first-term Georgia Republican, repeatedly endorsed executing top Democratic politicians on social media before she was elected to Congress, including telling a follower who asked if they could hang former President Barack Obama that the “stage is being set.” A review of Ms. Greene’s social media accounts, first reported by CNN, found that she repeatedly liked posts on Facebook that discussed the prospect of violence against Democratic lawmakers and employees of the federal government. Ms. Greene liked a Facebook comment in January 2019 that said “a bullet to the head would be quicker” to remove Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and liked another about executing F.B.I. agents. After a Facebook follower asked Ms. Greene “Now do we get to hang them,” referring to Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee, Ms. Greene responded: “Stage is being set. Players are being put in place. We must be patient. This must be done perfectly or liberal judges would let them off.” In a lengthy statement posted to Twitter on Tuesday before CNN published its report, Ms. Greene did not disavow the posts, but accused CNN of “coming after” her for political reasons and noted that several people had managed her social media accounts. “Over the years, I’ve had teams of people manage my pages,” Ms. Greene wrote. “Many posts have been liked. Many posts have been shared. Some did not represent my views.” After multiple reports of Ms. Greene’s endorsements of political violence, Representative Jimmy Gomez, Democrat of California, announced on Wednesday evening that he would introduce a resolution to expel her from the House. “Such advocacy for extremism and sedition not only demands her immediate expulsion from Congress, but it also merits strong and clear condemnation from all of her Republican colleagues,” Mr. Gomez said. “Her very presence in office represents a direct threat against the elected officials and staff who serve our government.” Expulsion from the chamber would require a two-thirds vote. Ms. Greene’s inflammatory language has drawn rebukes from some members of her own party. But since she joined Congress, House Republican leaders have declined to condemn her. Before she was elected, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican, disavowed her comments as “offensive and bigoted,” and Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, went so far as to back Ms. Greene’s primary opponent. A spokesman for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, told Axios that Ms. Greene’s newly surfaced Facebook posts were “deeply disturbing” and that he planned to “have a conversation” with her about them. Ms. Greene has previously been scrutinized for promoting conspiracy theories, including QAnon, the pro-Trump fringe group that falsely claims the existence of a satanic pedophile cult run by top Democrats, and for wrongly suggesting that the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., was staged. Ms. Greene was chosen this week to serve on the House Education and Labor Committee. In the days before pro-Trump insurrectionists stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, Ms. Greene referred to the day as Republicans’ “1776 moment.” After the riot, she pledged that President Donald J. Trump would “remain in office” and that attempts to remove him from the White House constituted “an attack on every American who voted for him,” even though he had lost the election.

Two officers who defended the Capitol have died by suicide, a police chief says. Dozens of police officers were injured during the storming of the Capitol this month. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A second police officer who defended the Capitol during the siege on Jan. 6 has died by suicide, the acting chief of the Metropolitan Police Department told Congress this week. Chief Robert J. Contee III told a House committee that Officer Jeffrey Smith, a 12-year veteran of his department, had killed himself on Jan. 15 and that Officer Howard Liebengood, a 15-year veteran of the Capitol Police, had also died by suicide days after the attack. The Police Department declined to give a cause for Officer Smith’s death or say whether it was connected to the riot. His family could not immediately be reached. Five people died during the attack, including one Capitol Police officer and a woman who was fatally shot by another officer; some died from medical emergencies. Serious trauma was also reported, including brain injuries and smashed spinal disks. The Capitol Police union said that nearly 140 of its officers were injured, and that one officer would most likely lose an eye. Chief Contee said in his testimony that 65 of his officers were injured in what he called a “battle.” He added that “many more sustained injuries from the assault — scratches, bruises, eyes burning from bear mace — that they did not even bother to report.” Videos from the Capitol on Jan. 6 showed rioters attacking officers who were defending the building. Some officers were dragged down stairs while others were beaten with hockey sticks. One was assaulted with an American flag. Officers were often outnumbered, unable to hold back crowds intent on entering the building. Some protesters were armed, and others said they wanted to hang members of Congress and former Vice President Mike Pence. “Other harm from this traumatic day will be widely felt but possibly unacknowledged,” Chief Contee said in his testimony. “Law enforcement training neither anticipates nor prepares for hours of hand-to-hand combat.”

Shannon Stapleton/Reuters Nearly 140 police officers from two departments were injured during the Jan. 6 pro-Trump mob attack on the Capitol, including officers who suffered brain injuries, smashed spinal discs and one who is likely to lose his eye, the Capitol Police union said on Wednesday. In a statement, the union’s chairman, Gus Papathanasiou, faulted leadership of the Capitol Police for failing to equip officers with proper equipment ahead of the attack. He was responding to the closed-door testimony on Tuesday of Yogananda D. Pittman, the acting chief of the Capitol Police, who acknowledged that the department had known there was a “strong potential for violence” that day but failed to take necessary steps to prevent what she described as a “terrorist attack.” Chief Pittman took the reins of the agency after the siege, replacing Steven Sund, who resigned as police chief under pressure. “We have one officer who lost his life as a direct result of the insurrection,” Mr. Papathanasiou said. “Another officer has tragically taken his own life. Between U.S.C.P. and our colleagues at the Metropolitan Police Department, we have almost 140 officers injured. I have officers who were not issued helmets prior to the attack who have sustained brain injuries. One officer has two cracked ribs and two smashed spinal discs. One officer is going to lose his eye, and another was stabbed with a metal fence stake.” Chief Pittman testified via videoconference before a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee that officers were outmanned during the riot, that internal communications were poor, and that officers lacked sufficient equipment and struggled to carry out orders like locking down the building. Her testimony marked the beginning of what is likely to be a series of hearings investigating the law enforcement failures that allowed the Capitol building to be occupied for the first time since the War of 1812. “By Jan. 4, the department knew that the Jan. 6 event would not be like any of the previous protests held in 2020,” Chief Pittman testified. “We knew that militia groups and white supremacist organizations would be attending. We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event. We knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.” Mr. Papathanasiou called it “inexcusable” that such warnings were not relayed to rank-and-file officers. “The officers are angry, and I don’t blame them,” he said. “The entire executive team failed us, and they must be held accountable. Their inaction cost lives.”

The leader of the Proud Boys has cooperated with the police before to help convict others. Enrique Tarrio, who took over leadership of the Proud Boys three years ago, has a criminal history dating to at least 2004. Credit... Victor J. Blue for The New York Times Enrique Tarrio, the chairman of the Proud Boys, a far-right nationalist group that is a major target of the sprawling investigation into the riot at the Capitol this month, has a history of cooperating with law enforcement, according to court records and a former prosecutor. The stunning revelation that Mr. Tarrio, who leads one of the country’s most notorious extremist groups, helped the F.B.I. and local police departments go after more than a dozen criminal defendants about a decade ago was first reported by Reuters on Wednesday. The news emerged as Mr. Tarrio himself has fallen under scrutiny for his role in encouraging the Proud Boys to attend a “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington on Jan. 6. “Mr. Tarrio was a cooperator — like many who seek to provide information and try to obtain substantial assistance,” the former prosecutor, Vanessa S. Johannes, wrote in an email. A court transcript, which documents a hearing in 2014 where Mr. Tarrio sought to reduce his own sentence in a fraud case, shows that he helped law enforcement officers in his home state, Florida, to investigate and prosecute criminal enterprises such as an illegal gambling business, a marijuana grow lab, an operation that sold anabolic steroids and an immigrant smuggling ring. Mr. Tarrio, 36, did not respond to messages from The New York Times seeking comment. But he denied to Reuters that he had ever worked undercover or cooperated with law enforcement. Mr. Tarrio has been a focus of the F.B.I.’s enormous inquiry into the Capitol attack, which has led so far to more than 150 arrests, including those of at least six members of the Proud Boys. The group of self-described “Western chauvinists” has a history of scuffling in street fights with left-wing antifascist activists and has made a name for itself in recent years for its vocal — and often violent — support of former President Donald J. Trump. Although Mr. Tarrio went to Washington this month, he was arrested by the local police on suspicion of burning a Black Lives Matter banner torn from one of the city’s Black churches during a separate round of protests in December. After he was thrown out of the city by a judge, he posted messages online encouraging the Proud Boys to attend the rally on Jan. 6 “incognito.”

"GameStop and AMC Entertainment tumbled in overnight trading, then rebounded sharply in the premarket Thursday following a meteoric rally amid a retail buying frenzy.

Shares of the brick-and-mortar video game retailer dropped 15.97% in extended trading, following a more-than 130% gain during regular hours. In premarket trading early Thursday, its shares bounced 30% higher.

The movie theater chain sank 26.58% in overnight trading, after shares soared 300% in extremely heavy trading. Its shares were little changed in premarket trading.

The pair have been popular targets in the ""Wallstreetbets"" Reddit chat room where a wave of at-home traders focus on heavily shorted stocks, pushing share higher and squeezing out short-selling hedge funds.

The forum, which has more than three million members, briefly went private as the moderators said they were ""unable to ensure Reddit's content policy.""

GameStop has rallied more than 400% this week alone, pushing its January gains to a jaw-dropping 1,700%. AMC has also skyrocketed over 450% this week. On Wednesday, more than one billion shares changed hands in AMC, marking its highest volume ever.

The heightened speculative behavior among retail investors is raising eyebrows on Wall Street and many grew concerned that it could be a sign of a bubble with the stock market at record highs.

"While the hedge funds and other professional money managers had been shorting GameStop’s shares, betting that its stock was doomed to further decline, the retail investors — online traders, mom-and-pop investors, small brokers and others — have been pushing the other way, buying shares and stock options. That caused GameStop’s market value to increase to over $24 billion from $2 billion in a matter of days. Its shares have risen over 1,700 percent since December. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, the market value rose over $10 billion.

The tribal framing online, as a kind of team sport pitting plucky upstarts against well-heeled Wall Streeters, has been especially helpful in motivating more investors to participate. This week, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, fueled the trading by posting about the Reddit page on Twitter. And speculation is growing that other investors are seeing fresh opportunities to push the stock even higher.

Ben Patte, 16, a high school student in Wisconsin who said he made $750 off GameStop stock, said the campaign felt like vindication for himself and fellow young traders. “It’s a good opportunity to make money and stick it to the hedge funds,” he said. “By buying GameStop, it’s kind of like beating them at their own game.”

GameStop vs. Wall Street Let Us Help You Understand Shares in GameStop, the video game retailer, have soared because amateur investors, starting on Reddit, have been bet heavily on shares of the company. The wave gained momentum in response to large hedge funds short selling GameStop stock — basically they were betting against the company’s success. The sudden demand has driven up the share price from less than $20 in December to nearly $200 on Thursday. On paper, anyway. It’s not just GameStop. Amateur investors have backed other companies that many big investors had shunned, such as AMC and BlackBerry. This bubble around GameStop may force big investors to raise money to cover their losses, or dump shares of other companies.



No one knows how this ends. Some analysts say the intense activity could eventually prompt a wider sell-off in the market by forcing hedge funds on the losing side of these trades to sell parts of their portfolios to raise cash to cover their losses. While this speculative frenzy played out on the market’s sidelines, the S&P 500 fell more than 2.5 percent on Wednesday, its worst day since late October, as the Federal Reserve gave a glum assessment of the economy and before a number of big tech companies announced their earnings.

“What happens in situations of stress is that people are forced to raise funds and that often means selling your winners,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Conn. “How does it end? Badly. Eventually, the bigger the balloon, the louder the pop,” said Mr. Sosnick. “When does it end? I don’t know.”"	-15.18
"U.S. stocks jumped on Thursday, roaring back from a sharp sell-off on Wall Street that saw the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffer their worst drop in three months.

The S&P 500 rose 0.98%, while the blue-chip Dow gained 300.19 points, or 0.99%, boosted by Disney, Intel and American Express. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5%.

All 11 S&P 500 sectors closed in the green amid the broad market rally. Financials and materials — cyclical sectors sensitive to an economic recovery — jumped 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Industrials and health care also led the strong gains.

The market suffered steep declines in the previous session, with the S&P 500 and the Dow posting their biggest one-day decline since October, as the speculative buying frenzy in heavily shorted stocks kept investors on edge. Some feared that hedge funds being squeezed could be forced to reduce their equity holdings to raise cash. Others called it a sign of a bubble forming in the market.

These stocks, including brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC), dropped sharply Thursday after brokerage firms like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood took steps to restrict transactions in the heavily shorted names.

""The bullish backdrop for stocks is strong, intact and so much bigger than GME; and when the latter stops going up, the former will stop going down,"" Rich Ross, a technical analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note.

GameStop, a red-hot target on the WallStreetBets Reddit chat room, fell 44% amid multiple trading halts, cutting its massive week-to-date gain to 197%. AMC Entertainment fell 56% after soaring a whopping 300% in the previous session. Bed Bath & Beyond slid 36%.

""The nonsense stocks continue to dominate a lot of the market conversation,"" Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note Thursday. ""Away from the land of make believe, the macro backdrop remains mostly the same, and mostly positive.""

Shares of GameStop have soared more than 900% in January alone as newbie day traders keep pushing each other to pile into the shares and call options, creating a massive short squeeze in the name. The stock is still the most shorted name in the market with 120% of its float shares sold short, according to FactSet.

Trading volume exploded amid the retail buying spree in the previous session with 23.7 billion shares changing hands, marking the heaviest trading day since at least 2007. On Wednesday, U.S. equity option volumes hit a record 24.5 billion shares and 57.1 million contracts, according to Piper Sandler.

""This is not investing. This is not planning for one's retirement with a diversified portfolio,"" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said in a note. ""This is not prudent analysis of stocks... And these traders forget that buying a stock is buying a piece of a company, but instead they are just speculating on a stock symbol in the ultimate game of hot potato.""

Shares of American Airlines surged 9.3% after the carrier posted better-than-feared quarterly results. Short covering also contributed to the gains as hedge funds and other short sellers rushed to buy shares to cut their losses. American Airlines is the most-shorted U.S. airline, according to FactSet.

Apple turned in its largest revenue on record at $111.4 billion in its fiscal first-quarter earnings report for fiscal 2021. Sales for every product category rose by double-digit percentage points. Shares of the tech giant, however, dipped 3.5%.

Tesla dropped 3.3% after the electric car maker posted worse-than-expected earnings for the latest quarter. The company also said it expects annual average delivery growth of 50% going forward.

On the data front, gross domestic product increased at a 4.0% pace in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 4.3% expectation from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

The number of first-time filers for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week. Jobless claims totaled 847,000 for the week ended Jan. 23, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones had expected first-time claims to total 875,000.

DRIVING THE DAY

MCCARTHY TRIES TO MAKE NICE WITH TRUMP: House Minority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY and former President DONALD TRUMP will meet around lunchtime at Mar-a-Lago — a face-to-face we’re told McCarthy requested after their relationship took a tumble in the wake of Jan. 6. McCarthy initially floated censuring Trump, angering the then-president. It’s their first in-person talk since the riot, and McCarthy hasn’t been shy about promoting it. “Kevin can’t shut up about it,” joked one top Trump adviser when we asked about the meeting. More on this below …

WHITE HOUSE LOOKS TO SPLIT COVID PACKAGE IN TWO — NEC Director BRIAN DEESE and Covid czar JEFF ZIENTS are scheduled to call into the weekly Democratic Senate lunchtime meeting today.

The two Biden aides will face an increasingly impatient caucus.

Deese has run two meetings with bipartisan groups in both chambers in recent days, one over the weekend with senators and another Wednesday with House members. Progressives are wary that President JOE BIDEN is too eager to cut a deal. Moderates are wondering why Deese hasn’t circled back with information they’ve requested.

Here’s what we’re told is the current White House thinking:

The Deese mission is to figure out what a “60-vote package” looks like. Biden aides are clear-eyed that such a deal will be far short of his $1.9 trillion proposal. A 60-vote deal would have skimpier funding for state and local relief (if any), and less money for vaccine distribution, unemployment insurance and nutritional assistance, or SNAP. It would have far more targeted relief checks. We are told by administration sources that a bill of this sort might be in the $600-$800 billion range.

The left would revolt. That’s where Part 2 of the Biden strategy comes into play. Its goal for now is to get the best deal possible that accomplishes a bipartisan result — a high-priority personal goal for the president — and then take everything that’s left out of the skinny relief package and add it to Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan. That would be passed using reconciliation, which requires a simple majority.

Voila! Biden can satisfy moderates with bipartisanship and progressives with the subsequent jobs bill.

BUT … The White House right now seems much more optimistic about the two-bill strategy than are Democrats on the Hill.

Said one progressive Dem senator: “My own judgment is that the space for a deal just doesn’t exist.” Even senior Democrats agree that a bipartisan deal is unrealistic.

The number that everyone keeps mentioning: 8.

That’s how many Republicans are involved in the current talks, which have produced nothing so far. Biden needs 10 Republicans for a 60-vote package.

But according to White House sources, if a 60-vote package never emerges, the backup plan is obvious: use reconciliation for both a large Covid bill and the follow-on jobs bill.

MORE ON THAT MAR-A-LAGO MEETING: The McCarthy-Trump relationship has been quite the soap opera lately, as we and a million other reporters have written. First, McCarthy said Trump was to blame for Jan. 6. Then Trump called McCarthy a “pussy.” Then McCarthy backtracked to say Trump didn’t “provoke” the riot.

Today, McCarthy will try to smooth things over, a process he started a few days ago. In Florida to raise money, the GOP leader plans to drop by Trump’s resort to inquire about the president’s political plans, we’re told. Unlike Senate Minority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL, who reportedly doesn’t want to speak to the ex-president ever again, McCarthy believes it’s in his interest to be on Trump’s good side. Banishing him could cause problems for House Republicans and imperil McCarthy’s dream of becoming speaker one day. Trump is popular with the base and — as far as McCarthy is concerned — still the leader of the Republican Party. We can’t help but wonder if he’ll bring red and pink Starbursts.

Trump world is ecstatic about the visit, viewing the huddle as proof of a comeback in the making. “It’s the first solid bit of evidence that Donald Trump is still in charge of the party,” said the Trump adviser. The person predicted Trump is “going to give Kevin an earful about the 10 members who impeached him,” and added: “You’ll have Trump crossing his arms and smiling while he reminds Kevin that Matt Gaetz is going out to Wyoming to challenge Liz Cheney and that he could be next.”

But there’s also a clear upside for McCarthy: The Trump adviser said the get-together establishes that Trump still sees McCarthy as his guy in Congress.

RELATED: A CASE STUDY IN GOP MESSAGING UNITY — Per our Mel Zanona, “McCarthy urges House Republicans to stop attacking each other publicly”; Per Dan Friedman on Twitter: “Gaetz asks ‘Patriots’ to assemble to ‘STOP RINOs like Liz Cheney.’ That reads ominously after 1/6.”

— “Biden taking first step toward bolstering Obamacare,” by Susannah Luthi: “The Biden administration on Thursday is expected to announce it’s throwing open the doors to the law’s enrollment site, HealthCare.gov, making it easier for the uninsured to get coverage during the pandemic. It is also expected to restore Obamacare marketing funds that the Trump administration had gutted, and it will soon begin the process of reversing the previous administration’s changes to Medicaid.”

— “Biden embraces order and routine in his first week. How will that fit this moment of crisis?” WaPo: “Biden’s first full week in office has showcased an almost jarring departure from his predecessor’s chaotic style, providing the first window into a tenure whose mission is not only to remake the White House in Biden’s image but to return the presidency itself to what he sees as its rightful path.

“The result so far is a 9-to-5 presidency — a tightly scripted burst of activity that was charted over the past few months, as Biden seeks to avoid heated conflict and stick to his plan of lowering the political temperature to a level that many Americans can tune out.”

CONGRESS

‘WE’RE ALL TOTALLY FREAKED OUT’: We’re hearing that lawmakers — particularly House Democrats — are reaching their wits’ end over the lack of guidance on how to protect themselves and their families amid heightened security threats. On Wednesday, the Homeland Security Department issued a bulletin that the domestic extremists behind the deadly Jan. 6 riot “could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence.” Lawmakers want answers from Democratic leadership, who unlike the rank and file have their own security details. Expect to hear more on this when House Democrats return next week. “We’re all totally freaked out about this,” one tells us. More from the NYT

— “House members say they’re ‘targets’ and ask for more security in new letter,” CBS … The letter

SARAH FERRIS: “Progressives push Biden for recurring stimulus checks”: “[A] group of House Democrats, led by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), sent a letter to the Biden administration on Thursday calling for regularly delivered checks through the end of the pandemic, rather than a single $1,400 payment that is likely to fall short of expenses like rent or mortgage payments. The letter obtained by POLITICO — which was also signed by Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) — does not call for a specific dollar amount. But Omar and other progressives have been vocal in their support for monthly $2,000 checks.”

FROM POLITICO INFLUENCE: “K STREET COMES TO CHENEY’S DEFENSE: More than four dozen GOP lobbyists are set to host a fundraiser for Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) next month, as the No. 3 House Republican takes on friendly fire for her vote this month to impeach former President Donald Trump. According to an invite for the event obtained by PI, the Feb. 8 fundraiser will require a $500 personal donation to get in the virtual door, $1,000 to be named a co-host and $2,500 to be named a host.”

“What’s notable, though, is that Liz Cheney has shed her old reputation for living off her father’s name and ideas, and vaulted into her new status — brave truth-teller in a party dominated by craven Trump enablers — mainly by drawing on a family legacy: Indifference to dissenting opinion. Liz Cheney surely knew there would be fierce backlash from within the House Republican caucus, where she is third-ranking leader, over her criticism of Trump and vote to impeach him. Her response, in essence, was: So?”

IMPEACHMENT II (FEB. 8)

ABOUT THOSE IMPEACHMENT ‘ALTERNATIVES’: Some Senate Democrats are eager to be done with impeachment now that it’s become clear Trump won’t be convicted. But they ran into a bit of a problem Wednesday: their new leader. While rank and file spent much of the day floating the idea of censure or banning Trump from running again via the 14th Amendment, Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER insisted those ideas wouldn’t be an end run around a trial. He seems eager to put Republicans on record.

Still, those other proposals could resurface in a couple of weeks, we’re told. Sen. TIM KAINE (D-Va.) is fine-tuning his resolution invoking the 14th Amendment to keep Trump from ever running for office again. And other Democrats are privately talking about this, too, should Trump be acquitted.

While a conviction requires a two-thirds majority of the Senate, the resolution can pass on a party-line vote with Democrats alone. Still, there’s been some discussion about whether the resolution could be subject to filibuster. If it is, Democrats would need to find 10 Republicans willing to buck Trump — a move those GOP senators could find politically painful in the short run but freeing long-term.

LET’S GET THIS OVER WITH: Senate Democrats are coalescing around the idea of a speedy trial. “I would hope we could get this done in a week,” Sen. CHRIS MURPHY (D-Conn.) says in a recap by our Marianne LeVine on the latest trial thinking. But as Mike DeBonis and Paul Kane write in WaPo, “[S]ome Democrats complained that an abbreviated trial would be shortsighted, ignoring the historical mandate to document what happened before, during and after the riot.” Remember: A solid chunk of Republicans still think it’s a good idea to keep Trump around. Do Democrats at least try to persuade them otherwise?

BIDEN POLICY

“But veterans of the last administration fear this newly empowered group of progressives may be naive about what can be achieved without undermining U.S. security, and are already warning them to prepare for a shock when they read the latest intelligence.”

ICE Has A New Plan To Change That,” BuzzFeed: “Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have drawn up guidance to direct officers to focus primarily on certain groups of immigrants, such as those suspected of being a national security threat, and require high-level approval for street operations as part of a draft memo obtained by BuzzFeed News that, if implemented, would likely lead to a significant drop in arrests.”

— “Blinken turns away from Trump-era approaches, starting with media relations,” WaPo: “Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried to reset the U.S. government’s relationship with the news media on his first full day in office, calling an independent press essential to the country’s global image and a ‘cornerstone of our democracy. ‘You keep the American people and the world informed about what we do here. That’s key to our mission,’ he said to reporters in the State Department briefing room Wednesday.”

“The review, the officials said, includes the sale of precision-guided munitions to Riyadh, as well as top-line F-35 fighters to Abu Dhabi, a deal that Washington approved as part of the Abraham Accords, in which the Emirates established diplomatic relations with Israel.”

"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18
"The Department of Homeland Security has issued a bulletin warning that extremists could ""continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence"" around the United States.

Acting Secretary of Homeland Security David Pekoske issued a National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin on Wednesday, citing a ""heightened threat environment across the United States"" that ""DHS believes will persist in the weeks following the successful presidential inauguration."" The bulletin comes three weeks after supporters of former President Donald Trump, who falsely claimed he won the 2020 presidential election, stormed the Capitol building in a violet riot to disrupt Congress' certification of the election results.

""Information suggests that some ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence,"" DHS said.

The DHS also said it's concerned that extremists ""may be emboldened"" by the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol building, though it added that domestic extremists have been ""motivated by a range of issues, including anger over COVID-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results, and police use of force.""

The last such advisory issued by DHS using this alert system was related to a potential threat from Iran following a U.S. strike that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020, ABC News reports. The White House last week announced that Biden has ordered a threat assessment focused on domestic extremism to be conducted in coordination with DHS in the wake of the Capitol riot.

""The January 6 assault on the Capitol and the tragic deaths and destruction that occurred underscored what we have long known: the rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national security threat,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. Brendan Morrow"	-15.18

"Michigan man pleads guilty in foiled plot to kidnap Gov. Whitmer and will 'fully cooperate'

Tresa Baldas | Detroit Free Press

Show Caption Hide Caption Prosecutors release videos from alleged kidnapping plot against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Some of the photos and videos were taken by a confidential FBI informant who was accepted as a member of the anti-government group and show weapons and rapid-fire training. U.S. Attorney's Office

DETROIT – Almost three months after his arrest, a Michigan man pleaded guilty to his alleged role in the foiled plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and agreed to ""fully cooperate"" with the FBI in exchange for leniency, including testifying against his cohorts if called upon.

Ty Garbin, an airline mechanic from Wixom, Michigan, pleaded guilty to a kidnapping conspiracy in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids on Wednesday morning, admitting that he was part of a group that sought to kidnap Whitmer from her vacation home and that he was more than a bystander.

Garbin said he cased Whitmer's vacation home in preparation for the kidnapping, attended training exercises and brought night binoculars to one exercise.

Garbin, 25, could face up to life in prison on the conspiracy charge. Federal prosecutors agreed to recommend a lighter sentence – they did not disclose any figures – in exchange for his cooperation. The judge will have the final say in his sentence.

Garbin is one of 14 men accused of conspiring to kidnap the governor, motivated largely by anger over her lockdown orders during the pandemic.

Before accepting his guilty plea, U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker reminded Garbin that he would give up his gun rights.

""You can’t lawfully own a firearm, ever again. You understand that? "" Jonker said.

""I understand that, your honor,"" Garbin said.

The judge reminded Garbin of his cooperation agreement.

""This could mean that you have to testify ... even if it means hurting people you know. Do you understand that?"" the judge said.

""I do, your honor,"" Garbin answered.

The judge went over the details of the case, including claims that Garbin and several others cased the governor's vacation home at night.

""You were part of that?"" Jonker asked Garbin.

""That's correct, your honor,"" Garbin responded.

""Surveilling her house at night ... you got involved of your own free will?"" the judge asked.

""I did, your honor,"" he responded.

""You knew what you were doing?"" the judge continued.

""I did, your honor,"" Garbin said.

Jonker accepted Garbin's plea and set a sentencing date for July.

Garbin's plea agreement includes new details in the case, including that the alleged ringleader, Adam Fox, prepared the basement where he lived for a kidnapping exercise and planned on using zip ties and a taser to ""neutralize"" the governor.

Defense lawyers argued that the defendants had no real plan to kidnap the governor but were only blowing off steam, talking tough and engaging in puffery.

Prosecutors said the suspects took steps to carry out their plan, such as casing the governor's home, drawing up maps and holding training exercises.

Garbin was the first to cut a deal in the case.

Garbin was an active participant in plot, prosecutors argue

Garbin and four of his co-defendants were arrested in an FBI sting Oct. 6 after undercover informants and agents infiltrated their group and learned of their alleged plan to kidnap the governor. One FBI agent said there was talk of taking Whitmer out on a boat and leaving her stranded in Lake Michigan.

Six men face federal charges in the case; Eight others with alleged ties to the kidnap plot face terrorism charges in state court for, among other things, allegedly plotting a violent revolt at the state Capitol.

After his arrest, Garbin's lawyer, Mark Satawa, argued that his client was a bystander in the plot and that he would be vindicated when the facts came out.

Prosecutors countered that Garbin was an active participant who carried out the following acts:

He cased the governor's vacation home at night.

He texted about blowing up a bridge to slow police down.

He offered to paint his boat for ""night fishing"" as part of the kidnapping mission on the lake.

Prosecutors used those allegations, along with claims that Garbin had the ability to manufacture guns, to convince a judge to deny bond to Garbin last fall. The government argued that Garbin was a danger to society and could not be trusted not to flee.

A magistrate judge agreed and ordered him detained.

All six federal defendants were denied bond. Eight others are charged in state court on terrorism and gun-related charges.

According to court records, Garbin was a member of the Wolverine Watchmen, a self-proclaimed ""militia,"" and met Fox at a Second Amendment rally at the state Capitol in Lansing.

The FBI said Garbin and others attended a firearms training in Cambria, Wisconsin, including an attempt to make an improvised explosive device.

According to court documents, the FBI reviewed encrypted group chats that indicated Garbin, Fox and others planned to meet an associate Oct. 7 ""to make a payment on explosives and exchange tactical gear.""

The rendezvous didn't go as planned.

When Garbin and his alleged cohorts showed up, FBI agents were waiting and arrested them instead.

"At one “field training exercise” in Cambria, Wis., in July the defendants used plywood, shipping pallets and a door frame to construct a “shoot house” to practice breaching the Michigan Capitol or other buildings, according to the documents. Adam D. Fox, the accused leader of the group, had allegedly sought to recruit 200 men for the attack, but it was later abandoned because it was too complicated and some members of the group opposed it.

In the plot to kidnap the governor, the defendants visited Ms. Whitmer’s vacation home in Michigan twice and planned to buy $4,000 worth of explosives to blow up a bridge to try to prevent the police from responding to their plan.

The group discussed waiting until after the election, as members anticipated widespread civil unrest that might make it easier to carry out the plan, the agreement said. At a field training exercise near Luther, Mich., the men also built a “shoot house” to simulate an attack on the governor’s house and practiced attacking it with firearms, the plea agreement stated.

The field training exercises also included attempts to build homemade bombs that included gunpowder, shrapnel and fireworks for ignition. Two attempts to explode such devices failed, according to court papers.

Gary K. Springstead, the lead lawyer defending Mr. Garbin, said his client already faced a life sentence for the kidnapping charge, a felony. Further charges for weapons or explosives were possible as federal officials released more details about what the group had done. The plea agreement could help lower the amount of jail time for the kidnapping plot and also stave off further charges, said Mr. Springstead.

During the preliminary hearings in October, Mr. Springstead and other lawyers in the case had focused on the idea that the men were practicing their First and Second Amendment rights when denigrating the governor.

The fact that the men had cased the governor’s house made any such defense much harder, he said. “There was a line that was crossed, something that you cannot undo,” the lawyer said."	-15.18

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys extremist group, has a past as an informer for federal and local law enforcement, repeatedly working undercover for investigators after he was arrested in 2012, according to a former prosecutor and a transcript of a 2014 federal court proceeding obtained by Reuters.

In the Miami hearing, a federal prosecutor, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and Tarrio’s own lawyer described his undercover work and said he had helped authorities prosecute more than a dozen people in various cases involving drugs, gambling and human smuggling.

Tarrio, in an interview with Reuters Tuesday, denied working undercover or cooperating in cases against others. “I don’t know any of this,” he said, when asked about the transcript. “I don’t recall any of this.”

Law-enforcement officials and the court transcript contradict Tarrio’s denial. In a statement to Reuters, the former federal prosecutor in Tarrio’s case, Vanessa Singh Johannes, confirmed that “he cooperated with local and federal law enforcement, to aid in the prosecution of those running other, separate criminal enterprises, ranging from running marijuana grow houses in Miami to operating pharmaceutical fraud schemes.”

Tarrio, 36, is a high-profile figure who organizes and leads the right-wing Proud Boys in their confrontations with those they believe to be Antifa, short for “anti-fascism,” an amorphous and often violent leftist movement. The Proud Boys were involved in the deadly insurrection at the Capitol January 6.

The records uncovered by Reuters are startling because they show that a leader of a far-right group now under intense scrutiny by law enforcement was previously an active collaborator with criminal investigators.

Washington police arrested Tarrio in early January when he arrived in the city two days before the Capitol Hill riot. He was charged with possessing two high-capacity rifle magazines, and burning a Black Lives Matter banner during a December demonstration by supporters of former President Donald Trump. The D.C. Superior Court ordered him to leave the city pending a court date in June.

Though Tarrio did not take part in the Capitol insurrection, at least five Proud Boys members have been charged in the riot. The FBI previously said Tarrio’s earlier arrest was an effort to preempt the events of January 6.

The transcript from 2014 shines a new light on Tarrio’s past connections to law enforcement. During the hearing, the prosecutor and Tarrio’s defense attorney asked a judge to reduce the prison sentence of Tarrio and two co-defendants. They had pleaded guilty in a fraud case related to the relabeling and sale of stolen diabetes test kits.

The prosecutor said Tarrio’s information had led to the prosecution of 13 people on federal charges in two separate cases, and had helped local authorities investigate a gambling ring.

Tarrio’s then-lawyer Jeffrey Feiler said in court that his client had worked undercover in numerous investigations, one involving the sale of anabolic steroids, another regarding “wholesale prescription narcotics” and a third targeting human smuggling. He said Tarrio helped police uncover three marijuana grow houses, and was a “prolific” cooperator.

In the smuggling case, Tarrio, “at his own risk, in an undercover role met and negotiated to pay $11,000 to members of that ring to bring in fictitious family members of his from another country,” the lawyer said in court.

In an interview, Feiler said he did not recall details about the case but added, “The information I provided to the court was based on information provided to me by law enforcement and the prosecutor.”

An FBI agent at the hearing called Tarrio a “key component” in local police investigations involving marijuana, cocaine and MDMA, or ecstasy. The Miami FBI office declined comment.

There is no evidence Tarrio has cooperated with authorities since then. In interviews with Reuters, however, he said that before rallies in various cities, he would let police departments know of the Proud Boys’ plans. It is unclear if this was actually the case. He said he stopped this coordination after December 12 because the D.C. police had cracked down on the group.

Tarrio on Tuesday acknowledged that his fraud sentence was reduced, from 30 months to 16 months, but insisted that leniency was provided only because he and his co-defendants helped investigators “clear up” questions about his own case. He said he never helped investigate others.

That comment contrasts with statements made in court by the prosecutor, his lawyer and the FBI. The judge in the case, Joan A. Lenard, said Tarrio “provided substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of other persons involved in criminal conduct.”

As Trump supporters challenged the Republican’s election loss in often violent demonstrations, Tarrio stood out for his swagger as he led crowds of mostly white Proud Boys in a series of confrontations and street brawls in Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.

The Proud Boys, founded in 2016, began as a group protesting political correctness and perceived constraints on masculinity. It grew into a group with distinctive colors of yellow and black that embraced street fighting. In September their profile soared when Trump called on them to “Stand back and stand by.”

Tarrio, based in Miami, became the national chairman of the group in 2018.

In November and December, Tarrio led the Proud Boys through the streets of D.C. after Trump’s loss. Video shows him on December 11 with a bullhorn in front of a large crowd. “To the parasites both in Congress, and in that stolen White House,” he said. “You want a war, you got one!” The crowd roared. The next day Tarrio burned the BLM banner.

Former prosecutor Johannes said she was surprised that the defendant she prosecuted for fraud is now a key player in the violent movement that sought to halt the certification of President Joe Biden.

“I knew that he was a fraudster – but had no reason to know that he was also a domestic terrorist,” she said."	-15.18

NEW YORK (AP) — The head of the Republican National Committee on Wednesday declined to encourage former President Donald Trump to run for the White House in 2024, saying the GOP would stay “neutral” in its next presidential primary.

In an interview, RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel also described the pro-Trump conspiracy theory group known as QAnon as “dangerous.”

The national GOP, under McDaniel’s leadership, spent the past four years almost singularly focused on Trump’s 2020 reelection. But should he run again in 2024 — and he has publicly and privately suggested he wants to — the national party infrastructure would not support his ambitions over those of other prospective candidates, in accordance with party rules, she said.

“The party has to stay neutral. I’m not telling anybody to run or not to run in 2024,” McDaniel told The Associated Press when asked whether she wanted to see Trump run again in the next presidential election. “That’s going to be up to those candidates going forward. What I really do want to see him do, though, is help us win back majorities in 2022.”

Just months removed from the last presidential election, several Republican prospects have already begun jockeying for position for the 2024 contest. McDaniel is far more focused on the 2022 midterms, when Republicans have an opportunity to break the Democrats’ monopoly on Congress.

McDaniel is in a difficult political position as she begins her new term as the national GOP chair.

She has been a devoted Trump loyalist, but as the RNC leader, she is also tasked with helping her party recover from its painful 2020 election season in which Republicans lost the Senate and the White House and failed to win back the House. Trump’s fervent base continues to demand loyalty to the former president, even as some party officials acknowledge that Trump’s norm-shattering behavior alienated elements of the coalition the GOP needs to win future elections.

Tensions are especially high within the party as the Senate prepares for Trump’s second impeachment trial.

Ten House Republicans voted earlier in the month to impeach the former president for inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, and on Tuesday, five Senate Republicans voted to move forward with a trial that could ultimately ban him from holding public office ever again.

McDaniel acknowledged the frustration of Trump’s base, which remains a powerful voice in the party and has little tolerance for Republican officials unwilling to stand behind the former president and his achievements in office.

But she repeatedly called for party unity and discouraged elected officials from attacking other Republicans — even those who voted to impeach Trump.

She declined to single out any specific Republicans when pressed, however, including Trump loyalist Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who is traveling to Wyoming this week to campaign against Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the highest-ranking House Republican who voted for Trump’s impeachment.

“If we’re fighting each other every day and attacking each other and brandishing party purism, we’re not going to accomplish what we need to to win back the House and take back the Senate, and that’s my priority,” McDaniel said.

She also forcefully condemned the pro-Trump QAnon movement, a large group of conspiracy theorists who were a visible presence at the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6. Trump repeatedly declined to denounce the group while in the White House.

Full Coverage: Politics

“I think it’s really important after what’s just happened in our country that we have some self-reflection on the violence that’s continuing to erupt in our country,” McDaniel said, pointing to violence across the political spectrum. “I think QAnon is beyond fringe. I think it’s dangerous.”

Moving forward, she said that voters, not Trump, are the head of the Republican Party, though Trump continues to maintain “a huge, huge presence” with his base.

McDaniel said she’s expecting several Republican leaders to play a significant role in the party’s future, mentioning former Vice President Mike Pence and Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations. Both are also considered potential 2024 presidential contenders.

She also downplayed reports that Trump is considering leaving the GOP and starting a new party, warning that such a move would divide Republicans and “guarantee Democrat wins up and down the ticket.

“It would be basically a rubber stamp on Democrats getting elected. And I think that’s the last thing that any Republican wants,” she said. “It’s clear that he understands that.”"	-15.18
"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland’s government put into effect on Wednesday a constitutional court decision banning terminations of pregnancies with foetal defects, as conservative policies increasingly take root in one of Europe’s most devout Catholic countries.

The Oct. 22 ruling had led to weeks of massive protests, forcing the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government to delay its implementation.

Small protests gathered late on Wednesday following an announcement PiS would take the official step to enforce the decision imminently, and abortion rights activists announced more would take place on Thursday.

Abortion has emerged as one of the most divisive issues since PiS took power in 2015, promising poorer, older and less educated Poles a return to a traditional society mixed with generous welfare policies.

The court’s verdict was published in the official gazette late on Wednesday.

“This idiotic ruling will not prevent abortions,” said Cezary Jasiński, a 23-year-old student, standing in front of the Constitutional Tribunal building in central Warsaw.

“But for every woman who will experience pain because of this ruling, or will be forced to give birth to a child with Down’s Syndrome, they (court judges) will be to blame.”

Last year’s protests quickly morphed into an eruption of anger against the government, particularly among young people, suggesting PiS may face a fresh challenge from new voters in coming years.

On Wednesday, officials said the government would now focus on assisting parents of disabled children, although PiS as well as its centrist predecessors have been accused by critics of not doing enough in that regard.

“The state can no longer take a life away only because someone is sick, disabled, in poor health,” PiS lawmaker Bartlomiej Wroblewski said.

The party denies opposition criticism that it had influenced the court, called the Constitutional Tribunal. It is one of the judicial bodies PiS overhauled during reforms that the European Union said has politicised the courts.

“No law-abiding government should respect this ruling,” Borys Budka, leader of Poland’s largest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform, told reporters.

Access to abortion has declined even without the legislative curbs as more doctors refuse to perform them on religious grounds and many women seek abortions abroad.

Under the new rules, terminations will be permitted only in cases of rape and incest, and when the mother’s life or health is endangered. Doctors performing illegal abortions in Poland face jail.

In a justification published on Wednesday, the tribunal left open the possibility of the parliament regulating some circumstances covered by the law.

Marek Suski, a PiS lawmaker, said the party would consider introducing new rules that could allow the most extreme foetal deformities to be excluded. But political commentators say consensus between PiS and its arch-conservative governing allies would be difficult to achieve.

“In cases when the foetus doesn’t have a skull or has no chance to live outside the womb, there should be a choice. We will work on this,” Suski told public radio.

Opinion surveys have shown some decline in PiS popularity in recent months, but an opinion poll by the government-affiliated CBOS pollster showed it edging back up to 35% this month, from 30% in October. PiS and its two small parliamentary allies won re-election in 2019 with a 44% share of the vote."	-15.18

About those wooly mittens that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders wore to the presidential inauguration , sparking endless quirky memes across social media? They’ve helped to raise $1.8 million in the last five days for charitable organizations in Sanders’ home state of Vermont, the independent senator announced Wednesday.

The sum comes from the sale of merchandise with the Jan. 20 image of him sitting with his arms and legs crossed, clad in his brown parka and recycled wool mittens.

Sanders put the first of the so-called “Chairman Sanders” merchandise, including T-shirts, sweatshirts and stickers, on his campaign website Thursday night and the first run sold out in less than 30 minutes, he said. More merchandise was added over the weekend and sold out by Monday morning, he said.

“Jane and I were amazed by all the creativity shown by so many people over the last week, and we’re glad we can use my internet fame to help Vermonters in need,” Sanders said in a written statement. “But even this amount of money is no substitute for action by Congress, and I will be doing everything I can in Washington to make sure working people in Vermont and across the country get the relief they need in the middle of the worst crisis we’ve faced since the Great Depression.”

Sanders’ mittens were made by Jen Ellis, a Vermont elementary school teacher who has a side business making mittens out of recycled wool. His inauguration look, also featuring the winter jacket made by Burton Snowboards, sparked countless memes from the photo taken by Agence France-Presse: The former presidential candidate could be found on social media timelines taking a seat on the subway, the moon and the couch with the cast of “Friends,” among other creative locales.

Ellis said on social media over the weekend that Sanders called to tell her that “the mitten frenzy” had raised an enormous amount of money for Vermont charities although she was not authorized to disclose the amount, yet.

“But it’s BIG and it’s amazing! Thank you!! Generosity brings joy,” she tweeted.

She also said she made three more pairs of mittens and donated them for fundraising to Passion 4 Paws Vermont, Outright Vermont, and would be auctioning off a pair on eBay for her daughter’s college fund.

The groups that will benefit from the proceeds of the “Chairman Sanders” items include Area Agencies on Aging to fund Meals on Wheels throughout Vermont, Vermont community action agencies, Feeding Chittenden, Chill Foundation, senior centers in Vermont and Bi-State Primary Care for dental care improvements in the state, Sanders’ office said.

Sander’ attire has also sparked other charitable endeavors. A crocheted doll of Sanders in his garb was auctioned off online and Burton Snowboards donated 50 jackets to the Burlington Department for Children and Families in Sanders’ name, his office said.

Getty Images confirmed that it will donate its proceeds as part of the licensing agreement to put the photo on the merchandise to Meals on Wheels of America."	-15.18
"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18
"Oscar winner and multiple Emmy winner Cloris Leachman, best remembered as the delightfully neurotic Phyllis Lindstrom on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” and her own subsequent sitcom, died of natural causes on Tuesday in Encinitas, Calif. She was 94.

“It’s been my privilege to work with Cloris Leachman, one of the most fearless actresses of our time,” her longtime manager Juliet Green said. “There was no one like Cloris. With a single look she had the ability to break your heart or make you laugh ’till the tears ran down your face. You never knew what Cloris was going to say or do and that unpredictable quality was part of her unparalleled magic.”

The daffy, self-absorbed Phyllis, a character she claimed was close to her own persona, brought the actress two Emmys as a featured actress in a series during the mid-’70s and made Leachman a household name.

Leachman also won a supporting actress Oscar in the early part of the decade for a far different character, an embittered small-town housewife in Peter Bogdanovich’s elegiac “The Last Picture Show”; she would later reprise the role in the film’s less successful sequel “Texasville.” Both films were based on the writings of Larry McMurtry.

Overnight success for the actress, however, came only after two decades of hard work in theater, television and some films. Leachman was in her 40s when stardom finally hit.

Leachman’s pitch-perfect timing and effortlessness in comedy and her unadorned honesty in drama was the result of many years honing her craft and incorporated her own life experiences as a mother of five children (by producer George Englund).

Her open, all-American look took her through several decades in a wide variety of roles on Broadway and early television as well as more than 40 movies, where she moved easily from leading roles to character parts.

The actress won a total of eight primetime Emmys, both for drama and comedy, and one daytime Emmy.

The recurring character of Phyllis Lindstrom on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” not only made her a TV star but also gave her time to squeeze in roles in film including “Lovers and Other Strangers,” “The People Next Door,” “WUSA” and “The Last Picture Show,” which brought her an Oscar for supporting actress in 1971 in an upset over her nominated co-star Ellen Burstyn. Two Emmys for the role of Phyllis were crowded alongside one for drama in the ABC TV movie “A Brand New Life” (1973) and led, in 1975, to her own series, which lasted a couple of seasons.

Decades later she was still working, and flying high: Leachman was a contestant on season seven of “Dancing With the Stars” in 2008, becoming, at age 82, the oldest contestant to dance on the series, and she was the grand marshal for the 2009 New Year’s Day Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, Calif.

During the 1970s, she did well by Bogdanovich’s “Daisy Miller” and was hilarious in Mel Brooks’ “Young Frankenstein”; she also appeared in Brooks’ “High Anxiety.”

She was given more interesting work to do in television. She won a fourth Emmy for a guest role on the variety series “Cher,” and she became a telepic staple during the period and did TV productions of Lanford Wilson’s “The Migrants” and Dorothy Parker’s “Ladies of the Corridor” on PBS.

Emmys five and six would come for ABC Afterschool Special “The Woman Who Willed a Miracle” in 1983 and the SAG 50th Anniversary celebration the following year.

She tried series regular work again, doing best with “The Facts of Life.”

Leachman continued work in TV movies, appearing in the miniseries “Backstairs at the White House” plus “In Broad Daylight,” “Little Piece of Heaven,” “Fine Things,” “Deadly Intentions,” “The Oldest Living Graduate,” “Advice to the Lovelorn,” “Miss All American Beauty,” “Dixie,” “Mrs. R’s Daughter,” “Fade to Black,” “Between Love and Honor,” “Miracle Child” and “Double, Double, Toil and Trouble.”

In 1996 she appeared in the Los Angeles touring version of “Showboat.”

During the 1980s and ’90s, Leachman worked intermittently in films including “The History of the World Part I,” “Walk Like a Man” and the 1993 bigscreen version of “The Beverly Hillbillies” in the role of Granny.

She seemed to transition effortlessly and even embrace the grandmotherly roles she found herself playing in the 1990s and 2000s.

Leachman recurred on “Malcolm in the Middle” from 2001-06 as Grandma Ida and earned several Emmy nominations and two more Emmy Awards (in 2002 and 2006).

In 2003, she played the grandmother on the bigscreen in the romantic comedy “Alex and Emma” and in the darker comedy “Bad Santa.” She also did voicework in animated movies “Beavis and Butthead,” “A Troll in Central Park” and the 2008 English-language version of the Japanese anime “Ponyo” as well as TV’s “The Simpsons.”

It was hard to see any evidence that she was slowing down.

She was a series regular on the brief Ellen DeGeneres vehicle “The Ellen Show” in 2001-02, recurred on “Touched by an Angel” and guested on “Diagnosis Murder,” “Joan of Arcadia,” “Two and a Half Men,” “The Office,” “Phineas and Ferb,” “Hawthorne” and “Blue Mountain State.” In 2010-14, she was a series regular on Fox’s “Raising Hope,” drawing her 19th Emmy nomination. (She was still regularly appearing in telepics as well.)

On the bigscreen, she was much busier in the decade-plus after 2000, when she was in her late 70s and early 80s, than in the previous decade.

Her film credits during the period included (but were by no means restricted to) “Spanglish” (2004), “The Longest Yard” (2005), “Scary Movie 4” (2006), “Beerfest” (2006) and “The Women (2008). In the (2009) anthology pic “New York, I Love You,” she appeared in a poignant but unsentimental segment as an elderly woman coping with the infirmities of her even more elderly husband (Eli Wallach).

In 2011 and 2012, Leachman pressed forward on the silver screen in a wide range of pics including “The Fields,” comedy “Gambit,” horror movie “The Home” and action-dramas such as “The Story of Bonnie and Clyde” and “Timberwolf.”

Born in Des Moines, Iowa, Leachman received working experience as a child at the Des Moines Little Theater. By age 15 she was appearing on local radio stations. She won a special scholarship to study broadcast drama at Northwestern, where she stayed for while before returning to Des Moines to finish high school. She returned to Northwestern with a theater scholarship this time but dropped out and entered a beauty contest, eventually finding her way to the 1946 Miss America pageant.

Moving to New York, she landed a role in a quickie movie, “Carnegie Hall,” and just missed out on landing the female lead in the Broadway comedy “John Loves Mary” to Nina Foch. She studied at the Actors Studio and made her Broadway debut in 1948 in the short-lived production “Sundown Beach.” She attracted notice as Cecilia in a Theater Guild production of “As You Like It” with Katharine Hepburn that ran for six months.

Her role in “A Story for Sunday Evening” brought her good notices in 1950, and she played Broadway for eight months in the 1954 Jean Kerr/Eleanor Brooke comedy “King of Hearts.” She also played Nellie Forbush in a special revival of “South Pacific.”

More steady training came via live television. She was a regular on the early series “Charlie Wild, Private Detective” (1950-52), and she excelled at bad girl roles. She also made guest appearances on TV series including “Gunsmoke” and “Alfred Hitchcock Presents.”

During this period she was seriously considered for the female lead in Charlie Chaplin’s bittersweet drama “Limelight,” but the role went to Claire Bloom. She then nabbed the role of a sexy hitchhiker in Robert Aldrich’s “Kiss Me Deadly.” She also landed a small role in Rod Serling’s film “The Rack” in 1956.

But television was much more conducive to motherhood, so she took a role as the mother in the “Lassie” series. Other TV work included Tennessee Williams’ “The Migrants” and George Gershwin’s “Of Thee I Sing.”

Leachman was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2011.

“Cloris: My Autobiography” was published in 2009. She penned the bestseller with George Englund, whom she divorced in 1979.

Survivors include sons Adam, George Jr. and Morgan, an actor; and a daughter, Dinah.

"Academy Award winner Cloris Leachman, one of the most decorated actors in television history, best known for playing nosy neighbor Phyllis on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" died Wednesday. She was 94.

She died of natural causes at her home in Encinitas, California, spokesperson Monique Moss confirmed.

Leachman won eight Emmy Awards in her storied television career, tied with Julia Louis-Dreyfus for the most individual acting awards in Emmys history. Leachman's Facebook cover shot depicts her sitting on a couch, surrounded by golden pals.

Leachman, who was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Hall of Fame in 2011, won the award for best supporting actress in a comedy series in 1974 and 1975 for her work as Moore's snobbish neighbor, Phyllis Lindstrom.

The show and the character were so popular that Leachman was spun off into her own show, ""Phyllis.""

She won the 1973 Emmy for best leading actress in the TV movie ""A Brand New Life,"" playing a first-time mother in middle age — a daring act in the era. Leachman was 46 when the ""ABC Movie of the Week"" aired Feb. 20, 1973.

Other Emmy wins included awards in 1975 for best supporting actress in a variety or musical for her work in ""Cher,"" in 1984 for best variety performance in the ""Screen Actors Guild 50th Anniversary Celebration"" and in 1988 for best actress in a guest role for ""Promised Land.""

Younger TV fans probably know Leachman best for ""Malcolm in the Middle"" as Malcolm's hilariously scheming grandmother. She was also a contestant on the 2008-09 season of ABC's ""Dancing with the Stars""; at the time, she was the oldest competitor in the show's history, at age 82.

The ""Malcolm"" gigs earned her Emmy Awards in 2002 and 2006 for best guest actress in a comedy.

Leachman insisted that she went into every awards night assuming she wasn't going home with a statue.

""I never had a speech because I never thought I was going to win,"" Leachman told the TV academy in a 2015 interview.

""But if you are good at what you do — and I always intend to be good at what I do — then the acclaim is just the follow-through. But it is a wonderful feeling,"" she said.

Leachman also won an Oscar, earning the 1971 award for best supporting actress in ""The Last Picture Show."" She played Ruth Popper, the lonely wife of the town's high school football coach.

Her film career also included a fan-favorite performance as Frau Blücher in Mel Brooks' comedy classic ""Young Frankenstein.""

""Such sad news—Cloris was insanely talented,"" Brooks tweeted Wednesday. ""She could make you laugh or cry at the drop of a hat. Always such a pleasure to have on set. Every time I hear a horse whinny I will forever think of Cloris' unforgettable Frau Blücher. She is irreplaceable, and will be greatly missed.""

But Leachman will be best known as ""Mary's"" neighbor and landlady. Of the actors who were in as many ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" episodes as Leachman, those who have died include Moore, Ted Knight, Georgia Engel and Valerie Harper.

Cast member Ed Asner tweeted a photo of himself with Leachman on Wednesday, saying, ""Nothing I could say would top the enormity of my love for you.""

A picture from the last time I saw you. Always beautiful. Nothing I could say would top the enormity of my love for you. Until we meet again darling. #clorisleachmanrip pic.twitter.com/9etOZo13Kb — Ed Asner (@TheOnlyEdAsner) January 27, 2021

When Moore died in 2017, Leachman said Mary Richards' sunny demeanor matched reality offstage.

""The picture that we all have of Mary, that's how she was — sweet, kind, so tender, so delicate,"" Leachman said. ""She was America's sweetheart. We loved you.""

In the show, Leachman's Phyllis frequently and hilariously clashed with Harper's Rhoda in on-screen conflicts that were the opposite of real life.

""'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' was a gorgeously written show. My character, Phyllis, wanted Mary to be her best friend ... and she couldn't stand Rhoda. Ha! In reality, Valerie and I were best friends,"" Leachman told the TV academy n 2015.

Leachman had slowed down in recent years. In a 2015 interview with NBC's ""TODAY"" show, she struggled getting out of a chair.

""I'm going to get up. It's very difficult. I can get this far,"" said Leachman, who was then 89, putting her hands on the chair's arms and pushing herself up several inches before freezing.

Even with a slower body, Leachman showed that her comedic mind was sharp as ever with a perfectly timed ""And then you come in,"" signaling for co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford, who came to her rescue.

Leachman credited her initial interest in radio and television to her mother, also named Cloris, who encouraged her to explore her creative side.

""Momma never pushed me to anything, always an invitation,"" Leachman said at her 2011 induction into the TV academy's Hall of Fame.

Leachman, who was born and raised in Iowa, was among the many famous actors who studied at Northwestern University. She moved to the outskirts of Chicago and competed in the 1946 Miss America competition as Miss Illinois.

""She loved her children and her grandchildren ferociously,"" Leachman's longtime manager Juliet Green said in a statement after her death. ""A lifelong vegetarian, she was a passionate advocate for animal rights. The family requests that any donations in her name be made to PETA or Last Chance for Animals.""

She is survived by her sons Morgan Englund, Adam Englund and George Howe Englund Jr. and her daughter, Dinah Englund. Leachman's former husband, George Englund, the father of her five children, died in 2017, and a son, Bryan Englund, died in 1986."	-15.18
"No one likes going to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), in fact, most people would probably choose getting a root canal over waiting in one of those long lines. At the end of the day, a root canal procedure is shorter, and in some cases, less painful. Case in point, going to the DMV is not a fun day at the park, so here are the most common complaints about visiting America’s least favorite waiting room.

Waiting, waiting, and more waiting

As you can already imagine, everyone’s biggest complaint is having to wait in line. It doesn’t matter if your local DMV has a number system to help things go a little smoother, or if you’re even able to make an appointment ahead of time, you’re going to be waiting in some fashion. Whether you’re there to take a driver’s license test, renew your car’s registration, or even just sort out some paperwork, you can easily be sure to spend a few hours at the DMV.

In case you didn’t know, the DMV is a government-funded agency and there’s a limit to what the employees can and cannot do, which means that some offices in some states may have a better system than others. For example, in Nevada, the DMV has the ability to hold your place in line and it will even text you when it’s your turn so that you don’t have to physically wait at the office. On the contrary, the DMV system in New Jersey only offers appointments in three of its locations, and those appointments are only for inspections, which means they operate solely on a “first-come, first-serve” basis, so you can be sure you’ll be waiting a while if you live there.

Rude and disgruntled DMV employees

Another common complaint about the DMV is the lack of empathy from its employees and other staff. That’s not to say that every DMV employee across the nation is completely disgruntled, but more often than not, you will find the person on the side of the counter with a solemn disposition.

Truth be told, DMV employees are basically in the same type of customer service line as anyone else, which means they have to put up with even more disgruntled customers every day. But, of course, it doesn’t help that neither party on either side of the counter really wants to be there, which ultimately contributes to the longer wait times.

The instructions on the DMV website aren’t always clear either

While visiting the DMV office can be an unpleasant experience most of the time, the DMV websites in some states are all that much better. As a personal story, when I moved from California to Colorado, I went to the DMV to see what I needed to change my driver’s license. The DMV’s website clearly stated that I would need two different proofs of residence, my current license, and another form of I.D. However, when I got to the counter, the DMV employee asked for my social security card in addition to all of the forms I brought with me.

After I told her that I didn’t have it, she said that I would need to make another appointment and come back, which ended up being two months later. I double-checked the website again, and it doesn’t state anywhere that I needed to bring my social security card with me, which completely wasted my time.

What can you do to get a better DMV experience?

If you do need to visit the DMV in the future, there are ways that you make the experience quicker and easier. Always make sure to make an appointment first and make sure that you have all of the forms you need to bring with you. If you are unsure of all of the forms you need, then call the number for your local DMV office and make sure you get someone on the line to help you. Doing so could save you a lot of time and effort in the long run."	-15.18
"Washington state has partnered with Seattle-based coffee giant Starbucks on its COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Several Starbucks staff will work full-time on the rollout, choosing and designing vaccination sites.

""I just did the math, and figured out at this rate of vaccination, it's going to take six, seven, eight years for this country to get vaccinated,"" Starbucks' CEO Kevin Johnson told NBC News.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Coffee giant Starbucks will help with Washington's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, in a partnership announced Monday by state governor Jay Inslee.

""Several"" Starbucks employees will work full-time to help choose sites for vaccination, and help with the design of those sites, Starbucks said at a press briefing, per Forbes.

Kevin Johnson, CEO of Starbucks, approached the state to offer help. ""I just did the math, and figured out at this rate of vaccination, it's going to take six, seven, eight years for this country to get vaccinated,"" Johnson said. ""So we have to dramatically scale this up and accelerate the progress.""

Starbucks is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and the partnership is unique to the state.

The Starbucks deal is one of a number of state partnerships with private companies announced Monday to try to get more Washington residents their shot. Microsoft, also headquartered in Washington, will supply technological expertise, and Kaiser Permanente will provide healthcare delivery support, NBC News reported.

Inslee said Monday the state wanted to give 45,000 vaccine doses every day, according to NBC News. So far, more than 242,000 COVID-19 vaccine shots have been given in Washington state, which has a population of 7.6 million people.

Across the US, 12 million shots have been administered, according to CDC data — a figure that falls short of President Donald Trump's target to immunize 20 million Americans by the end of 2020.

""Starbucks is not a healthcare company, but we do operate 33,000 stores at scale, serving 100 million customers per week,"" Johnson said at the press briefing, per Forbes."	-15.18
"COVID vaccines were developed with record-breaking speed. But their distribution has been anything but quick. As of Monday morning, about 47 percent of the doses distributed to states had not been administered, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This means that a month into the distribution effort, only about 6 percent of people in the U.S. have received at least one dose of the two-dose vaccines that are now available. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, estimates that up to 90 percent of the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity—the point at which so many people are protected from the disease that it peters out.

In an effort to pick up the pace, many states have expanded access to a COVID vaccine to everyone aged 65 and older, people with medical conditions that put them at high risk of the disease and certain essential workers. But the hodgepodge of policies and priorities in different states and the lack of unified infrastructure has caused chaos and confusion for people eager to get their shot. Many of the country’s most vulnerable people are encountering busy phone lines, crashing Web sites, byzantine online registration portals and long lines at vaccination sites, prompting concerns that the expanded rollout could worsen the racial and economic inequalities laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Emergency physician and former Baltimore health commissioner Leana Wen has been vocal about the tough decisions that must be made to address this distribution debacle. Wen spoke with Scientific American about how authorities decide who is next in line, the hurdles in getting vaccinated that some people are facing and the need to balance speed with fairness.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

How do we decide who to prioritize for vaccines? And how does the ethics of who is “deserving” play into that process?

The CDC has an advisory committee that took painstaking approaches to determine the priority tiers. The determination of who went first—health care workers and nursing home residents—was fairly uncontroversial. Beyond that, I think it gets to the question you are asking, which is not necessarily who is “deserving” but rather what problems we are trying to solve. Is it most important to safeguard those who don’t have the option to social distance? Or is it more important to reduce illness? I don’t have an answer here, but the way the vaccine rollout has been going so far is not working. The tiers look good on paper, but they are so rigid. And there are so many problems with matching supply and demand on the ground that the lack of flexibility has resulted in the great tragedy of doses being wasted. At this point, the necessary step is to relax the measures and open vaccination up to broader categories of eligibility because there has been a lack of infrastructure to implement this the right way.

Why is the vaccine distribution going so poorly?

It’s a combination of two things that are interrelated. One is that the federal government seems to have understood its role in the vaccine process as stopping at the point at which it gets vaccines distributed to states. I don’t think this was apparent before, but it certainly is now. [The federal government] entirely ceded the responsibility of the “last mile,” so to speak. The second related issue is that the state and local health departments put in charge of this last mile have not had the funding that they need. State and local health departments were already substantially underfunded and understaffed even before the pandemic. And then they had to take on testing, contact tracing, public education, and helping businesses and schools to reopen safely with a very limited budget. Now they’re being told to stand up this vaccination program without additional staff or additional resources. I heard a health official liken this to being given brand-new shiny vehicles but with no gas. State health departments requested $8.4 billion, but [at first] only received $400 million. [Editor’s Note: The most recent $900-billion COVID relief bill included the remaining $8 billion in funding for vaccine distribution.]

Is the public vaccine rollout making it difficult for people who might not have a lot of resources or the wherewithal to navigate all the red tape?

As we move on to vaccinate as many people as we can, those who are already disadvantaged and those who are already the most vulnerable will have less access again. The people who are wealthier and privileged—those who can keep calling a hotline because they have a cell phone with unlimited minutes or can figure out how to sign up online because they have good Internet and are tech-savvy—will have an advantage. If you make it first come, first served, you will vaccinate more people, but it will come at the cost of not prioritizing fairness. There are no clear answers. I think you need to keep on looking toward fairness and equity. But that really should not come at the cost of speed either. How you balance those is extremely tricky.

Is it fair to open up eligibility so widely, when so many people at high risk still have not been vaccinated?

You have to consider a balance of fairness versus speed. If fairness is the overriding principle, then it will be slower because it will take time to reach individuals who don’t have much access or resources or might be vaccine-hesitant. But there’s definitely an argument to be made at this point in the pandemic—when thousands of people are dying every day—that speed is paramount. All the individuals who are vaccinated were once susceptible to coronavirus, so every dose that you’re getting into an arm is necessary and will help.

But how do you address those concerns without further exacerbating the inequalities so clearly exposed by the pandemic?

It may be that we get out the doses as quickly as we can in this first tranche while we’re building the infrastructure to reach these hard-to-reach and more vulnerable communities. I think there is a way to do both. But there needs to be some acknowledgment that some trade-off has to occur.

Do you think these logistics hurdles will get better or worse going forward? Will distribution get even trickier as more people become eligible?

The hope when these tiers were very carefully designed was that people would have some sense of when it’s their turn. If we had a functional system, then, in theory, you would enter in your information, find out when you would likely be eligible to get vaccinated, and then get an e-mail or a call at that time. But we don’t have anything close to a system like this for something that is in such high demand. I think the next best thing is to open it up to a lot more people, and that includes creating community access points. Offer the vaccine at doctor’s offices, pharmacies, grocery stores, mass vaccination sites. Will it be confusing? Absolutely, because each state will still have its own rules. And it will lead to that first come, first served mentality. But it will be better than the other scenario, which is letting a whole lot of vaccine go to waste.

How urgent is this issue?

This is a race against time. We need to get out the vaccine in order to reach herd immunity. We know this virus—like every virus—is constantly mutating. We are already seeing the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the U.K. and the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa, which are more transmissible. There may well be home-grown U.S. variants that we find over time that are not only more transmissible but also more virulent and cause more severe disease. [Editor’s Note: As of this writing, another variant called L452R, which was first detected in Denmark, has been linked to several outbreaks in California, but it is not yet known whether it is more contagious or virulent.]

Imagine if this pandemic were a war against a foreign enemy where 3,000 to 4,000 Americans were dying every day. We wouldn’t even question the idea of devoting all our resources to this effort. That’s what should be happening now. [Many] Americans have not done the other measures that are needed. We’ve squandered all our other chances. The vaccines are our last best hope.

"New York City is on pace to run out of COVID-19 vaccine doses and be forced to cancel appointments within a matter of days, Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) has warned.

The New York mayor in a briefing Tuesday said that the city ""desperately"" needs more supply as COVID-19 vaccinations move ""faster and faster.""

""At the rate we are going, we will begin to run out on Thursday — this Thursday, two days from now,"" de Blasio said. ""And we will have literally nothing left to give as of Friday. ... If we don't get more vaccine quickly, a new supply of vaccine, we will have to cancel appointments and no longer give shots after Thursday for the remainder of the week at a lot of our sites.""

De Blasio went on to say that ""on the current schedule,"" New York City isn't set to be resupplied until next Tuesday, meaning ""many of our sites"" wouldn't be able to begin administering vaccines again until next Wednesday.

""This is crazy,"" de Blasio said. ""This is not the way it should be. We have the ability to vaccinate a huge number of people. We need the vaccine to go with it.""

De Blasio called on the federal government to do everything possible ""to get us the maximum supply"" of vaccines, and one day ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, he expressed hope that the incoming administration ""is going to fix a lot of this."" Brendan Morrow"	-15.18
"It’s been slow going this week to get a vaccine in California.

With supplies limited, many parts of California have struggled to keep up with demand, in some cases saying appointments are full for the coming days.

Right now, officials are giving vaccinations only to long-term care facility staff and residents, health workers and those 65 and over. But there have been questions about who will come next. Gov. Gavin Newsom offered some clarity on that — though many questions still remain.

Q: What were the changes Newsom announced Monday?

Advertisement

Newsom said the state would switch to an age-based eligibility approach. No details about the criteria were released Monday, but they could end up focusing on people over 50 first. It’s also unclear if there would be a special designation for those with preexisting conditions.

Q: Is this a change?

Yes. Under the original plan’s tier structure, Tier 2 workers in manufacturing, transportation and commercial and residential settings along with incarcerated people and homeless people would be prioritized.

So essentially, Newsom is now prioritizing age over those specific cohorts.

Some groups have pushed for these changes. But some labor unions have criticized the changes, noting that essential workers are putting themselves at risk and should get vaccines as soon as possible. Disability rights groups say the changeup fails to prioritize those at highest risk for COVID-19 complications.

Q: When should someone expect to enter the next phase?

Last week, state officials said it could take until June to offer vaccinations to all those 65 and older. Los Angeles County estimated all residents might not be able to be vaccinated until 2022 unless more supply becomes available.

State epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan said last week that the state is receiving 300,000 to 500,000 doses each week. In Los Angeles County, 500,000 doses would be needed per week in order to vaccinate all adults by mid-summer, chief science officer Dr. Paul Simon said Friday. But at the rate that the current allocation is going, efforts would continue well into 2022.

Q: What about teachers?

The state has said that individuals 65 and older and healthcare workers are the current priority, followed by teachers, workers in food and agriculture and emergency services. Currently, it remains uncertain when those groups could start to actively sign up for vaccinations. But it’s becoming clear that vaccinating teachers is the key to reopening schools to in-person learning.

This lack of clarity has led to growing anger as the school year slips away.

Assemblyman Patrick O’Donnell (D-Long Beach) expressed frustration that educators are not being prioritized by the L.A. County Health Department even as teachers in Long Beach are scheduled for vaccines this week. Although Long Beach is part of L.A. County, it operates its own independent health agency. L.A. County health officials said Monday that there are simply too many people in high-priority categories who need vaccines and too few doses.

L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said she hopes teachers in her jurisdiction could begin to be immunized in February or March, but that would depend on the vaccine supply. The last day of instruction for the current school year in Los Angeles is June 10.

L.A. schools Supt. Austin Beutner and the Los Angeles Teachers Union are essentially in agreement on the two critical points needed for school reopening: teacher vaccination and a significant drop in coronavirus infection rates in communities served by L.A. Unified.

Q: How has the vaccine rollout been going this week?

Advertisement

Slow.

Some regions including L.A. County said they have filled appointments for the next few days and hope to begin offering more soon.

Officials warn that vaccines will be in short supply in part because people who already have received their first shot now need their second. That will reduce the number of doses available for people seeking their first vaccination. Officials have estimated that if L.A. County gets 140,000 new doses this week, those needing a second dose would get the lion’s share.

The weather is another factor. Strong winds and harsh weather conditions Monday forced the Orange County Health Care Agency to close its Disneyland vaccine supersite in Anaheim, turning away thousands of appointment holders for the third time since last week.

“At 3:30 p.m. today, our Disneyland Super POD site closed due to safety concerns related to inclement weather,” read a tweet posted by the agency. “Everyone who had an appointment today, Jan. 25, at 3:30 p.m. or later will be rescheduled for Wednesday, Jan. 27 at the same time.”

The post referred viewers to the Othena.com website and smartphone app, which have experienced backlogs in recent weeks, as tens of thousands of Orange County residents clamor to book appointments for individuals older than 65 and other Phase 1A individuals.

Here are the basics:

Los Angeles County: Residents 65 and older can sign up for an appointment at the county Public Health Department’s website . Residents without computer access can call (833) 540-0473 between 8 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. for assistance with reservations. The city of Los Angeles is also offering the vaccine to those 65 or older, through a different online portal. That website connects patients to mass-vaccination sites.

Orange County: The county opened a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination site Saturday at Soka University in Aliso Viejo. The county launched its first vaccination center at Disneyland in Anaheim. Eventually, the county plans to operate five centers, which health officials say is key to their goal of getting all residents vaccinated by July 4. For now, only healthcare workers, residents of long-term-care facilities and people 65 and older are eligible to be vaccinated at the centers.

"According to Pennsylvania licensure requirements, which the City of Philadelphia follows, only certain medical professionals — including doctors, nurses, and pharmacists — may administer immunizations. Students and other technicians may be eligible to administer vaccines under direct supervision. Doroshin, a graduate neuroscience student at Drexel, does not meet any of those criteria for who can inject a vaccine.

In an unrelated interview last week, Health Department spokesperson James Garrow used this very scenario as an example of a disqualifying practice for the city-partnered organization.

“If Andrei Doroshin is giving out vaccines, I would want to know that because then we would shut them down,” Garrow said.

Lipinsky also said that there were pre-med, nursing students, and staffers who were administering the vaccines, and filling syringes with fluid. According to Pennsylvania law, those individuals are allowed to vaccinate if they are under direct supervision. Lipinsky said clinical professionals were nearby, but not directly supervising.

“They were running around like kids at the end of the day vaccinating each other,” she said.

Another volunteer described a similar scene at the end of the day at the clinic the week prior, as well.

“It was a free-for-all,” said the volunteer, recounting 18- or 19-year-old college students vaccinating one another and taking photos as the clinic ended, without supervision.

Lipinsky herself was not asked for her credentials as a registered nurse until after she had already volunteered at the clinic, she said.

Farley said Tuesday he was not aware of anyone without the proper credentials administering the vaccine. He denied knowledge of any other misconduct from Philly Fighting COVID beyond the concerning privacy language in their incorporation documents and their abrupt abandoning of testing.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner released a statement asking people who have information about what they believe to be crimes involving Philly Fighting COVID or other pandemic relief efforts to contact his office’s Special Investigations Unit at DAO_SIU@phila.gov or 215-686-9608.

Attorney General Josh Shapiro said, “Taking advantage of people and their privacy under the guise of serving as a nonprofit is not only unethical — it can also be against Pennsylvania law. These allegations against Philly Fighting COVID are serious and any consumers who believe they have been misled should file a complaint with our office — online, by phone or by emailing charities@attorneygeneral.gov. We have been in touch with the City to obtain any information they can provide about these allegations. Our office oversees charitable organizations in the Commonwealth and we will ensure they are acting in good faith with the communities they serve.”

Formed last spring, Philly Fighting COVID went from a student-run group manufacturing PPE, to erecting one of the largest citywide coronavirus testing operations, to the city’s first mass vaccine distributor in just nine months’ time.

That astral trajectory came to an abrupt close on Monday after the city spent weeks distancing itself from the once-confident partner in the fight against the pandemic. It remains unclear whether the city knew about the allegations that Doroshin was taking vaccines on Saturday prior to terminating their relationship.

In recent interviews with national publications, Doroshin compared his vision for a vaccination program into a McDonald’s-like franchise and “a factory” that could move from city to city. He also advocated to “stop using best practices” for the sake of efficiency.

“The old best practices in healthcare in terms of intramuscular injections were written for a hospital visit that would take 30 minutes that you would bill for as a provider visit,” Doroshin told HealthDay in an interview last week. “Most of those best practices can go out the window.”

The city said it will have no trouble replacing Philly Fighting COVID’s role in Philadelphia’s vaccine distribution plan, with more details coming soon. Farley said the Health Department may staff a clinic with its own employees

This is a developing story and will be updated."	-15.18
"For the past week, Israel has been vaccinating about 1.5 percent of its population daily — roughly 150,000 people per day — making it a world leader in vaccinating against COVID-19.

New cases have surged to a three-month high, but health authorities have still managed to vaccinate about 50 percent of the country's high-risk population. Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said in a press conference that the entire Israeli population could be vaccinated as soon as April.

""Within a time period of two to three months, we'll be able to vaccinate the entire population that can be vaccinated,"" Edelstein said. He added that inoculating the general public is expected to begin by next month.

Israel is moving so fast, they're already planning for the day after the pandemic ends.

""I estimate that by late March, early April most of those who so desire will be able to be vaccinated and then we can begin a large-scale opening of the economy and cultural activities,"" Edelstein said.

On Monday, the Health Ministry unveiled its proposed ""green passport"" that will grant vaccinated Israelis permission to attend large gatherings and cultural events. ""It's actually really an amazing project where everybody took part in it,"" said professor Gili Regev, director of the infectious disease unit at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel's largest hospital.

Regev said Israel's successful campaign is largely thanks to its community-based health system. By law, all Israelis must be registered with one of the country's four health care providers. In a small country of 9 million people, Regev said, the vaccination effort has been a huge success.

""And I think also the compliance of the population,"" Regev said. ""There was a lot of PR about this, on how important it is and that this is really the only way to stop this pandemic. And I think all of those together is what actually made this happen. And yeah, it's really exciting.""

Israel signed agreements with multiple drug companies for vaccines, but it's distributing them faster than new shipments are arriving. By contrast, the situation next door in the Palestinian West Bank is very different.

Outside the city of Nablus, Dr. Murad Shawer is the physician in charge at Hugo Chavez hospital, where the most complicated COVID-19 cases are sent from all across the West Bank. He and about 3 million other Palestinians living under Israeli military control will have to wait much longer for a vaccine.

""It's very stressing [sic] for me and for all the personnel,"" Shawer said. ""We have now crossing [sic] the peak of the disease and it will continue during the next three months at least.""

Numbers of new cases are starting to go down, Shawer said, and he believes the vaccine will have an impact.

""I think [the] vaccine can help to get our target, but now I don't know how much time we have to wait to get this vaccine,"" Shawer said.

So far, the cash-strapped Palestinian National Authority hasn't signed a single deal with any of the vaccine manufacturers. But Palestinian officials say it's a top priority.

""We are in contact with Pfizer, with Sputnik-5, with AstraZeneca, with all the manufacturers,"" said Dr. Ali Abed Rabbo, director-general of the Palestinian Health Ministry. ""The only one signed is with the COVAX facility that will provide 20 percent of the Palestinian population.""

COVAX is the initiative co-led by the World Health Organization to ensure a more equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines around the world.

Rabbo hopes the first vaccines will arrive next month, but he doesn't seem too optimistic about that timeframe. He said there is a dialogue with Israel to facilitate the entry of the vaccines once they arrive.

""But I think that there is a responsibility of Israel, who is, under international law, the occupying force, to provide all these vaccines and all the needs of the people in the occupied territory.""

In Israel, a debate continues about its legal responsibility toward Palestinians during the pandemic. But what about the moral question?

Regev, from Sheba hospital, said that Israel should be doing more to help get vaccines to the Palestinians.

""Definitely I think we should,"" she said. ""There is the Israeli vaccine which is also being developed and some people said, 'Well, why do we need to develop it if we have enough vaccines?' Obviously, we need to develop it because the world needs vaccines. I think everybody should put an effort in developing the vaccines and distributing them, and yeah, and vaccinating all of the populations in need.""

Israel's health minister recently said that the government's first obligation was to its own citizens. As for the Palestinians, he said, ""If, God willing, there will be a situation where we can say we are in a position to help others, no doubt it will be done.""

"From the September 2020 issue: How the pandemic defeated America

So how exactly has Israel pulled off this unlikely feat? The answer traces back decades to the embryonic health infrastructure created before the State of Israel even existed. That, in turn, should serve as a sobering reminder for Americans: Nations faring well against the virus are drawing on preexisting strengths, not flexing muscles suddenly conjured amid the crisis or, say, a change in administrations.

The countries that have performed best against COVID-19 have been those “that in general have good public-health infrastructures—and we [in the United States] just don’t,” Helene Gayle, the head of the Chicago Community Trust and a veteran of the CDC, told me.

“There’s a big lesson from this, which is: You’re not going to be ready for a pandemic if you don’t have your data systems in place, your surveillance systems, your state-level funding for the infrastructure, so that you can distribute [vaccines] effectively and fast,” argued Gayle, a co-chair of a recent study on how to equitably allocate COVID-19 vaccines.

And as the world shifts from focusing solely on containing the virus to rolling out vaccines as well, the key determinant of success is morphing from the credibility of the government to the credibility of the health-care system. As the scholars Jeremy A. Greene and Dora Vargha have observed, vaccines are at least in part “technologies of trust” that rely on people “maintaining confidence in national and international structures through which vaccines are delivered.”

The apparent paradox of Israel being both a “vaccine champ” and a “contagion chump,” as the Israeli journalist David Horovitz memorably put it, becomes less mystifying on closer inspection. Whereas some countries that did better in flattening the curve of coronavirus cases, such as Australia and South Korea, at first proceeded cautiously with plans to approve and procure vaccines, because they felt they had the virus under control, pandemic-battered Israel didn’t have that luxury. What the Israeli government felt instead was urgency.

Ahead of elections this March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cast himself as the face of the country’s vaccination campaign (he got Israel’s first COVID-19 shot) and its dealmaker in chief, negotiating directly with Pfizer’s CEO and reportedly paying Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna top dollar to receive doses quickly and at scale when global supplies are tight.

Netanyahu recently announced an agreement with Pfizer that will send hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses to Israel per week. Israel, in turn, will serve as something of a national clinical trial—or, in the prime minister’s words, a “global model state for the rapid vaccination of an entire country.” It will send Pfizer anonymized medical information about the effects of the vaccine on the population and on curbing the epidemic. The statistical data could yield lessons not only for Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies as they continue to develop COVID-19 vaccines, but also for other countries and international organizations working on their own vaccination campaigns."	-15.18
"The government is using your driver's license to play Big Brother.

Driving is a privilege, not a right. But it's a privilege that has become a virtual necessity. For many Americans, a driver's license is a also license to earn a living, see friends, go shopping, and get away from it all on the weekends. Take away that card, and people will do almost anything to get it back. They'll even pay their parking tickets.

""Suspension of a driver's license is more effective than a court order"" for getting money out of people, says David Lewis, Deputy Registrar of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. In Massachusetts, you can't renew your driver's license if you have outstanding parking tickets, unpaid moving violations, or if you owe excise tax on your automobile.

""It's the most effective thing that you can do without throwing them in jail,"" says Peter Nunnenkamp, manager of driver programs at Oregon's Driver and Motor Vehicle Services. ""And it's fairly cost effective."" In fact, it's so effective that Oregon has 109 different offenses that can result in the temporary suspension of a driver's license; 50 of them have nothing at all to do with driving.

""Most law abiding people take it very seriously. They pay their fines and pay their reinstatement fee,"" says Julie Clark, deputy director of Wisconsin's Bureau of Driver Services. In Wisconsin, you can lose your driver's license if you forget to pay your library fines, don't shovel the snow off your sidewalk, or don't trim a tree that overhangs a neighbor's property.

The driver's license has become something it was never intended to be: a badge of good citizenship. Pay your bills to city and state, pay your child support, don't get caught using drugs, and the state will let you keep on trucking. Screw up, and they'll clip your wings. And for those who don't get the message and stay on the roads? In most states, getting caught driving without a license, or with one that's been suspended or revoked, means handcuffs, a trip down to the local jail, and having your car towed to the pound.

In other words, it's serious shit.

Most businesses and state agencies have a problem with outstanding debt. Bounced checks, IOUs, stolen credit cards - it all adds up. Some organizations write off anywhere from 5 to 20 percent of their debts as ""uncollectable.""

Most agencies, that is, except for the DMV. ""We don't have debt,"" says Lewis, who oversees all of the Massachusetts Registry's computer and information systems. Last year, the Massachusetts Registry collected more than US$660 million in fees and fines; less than $600,000 came back as bounced checks - a whopping 0.1 percent. ""How can you afford to stiff us?"" Lewis asks rhetorically. ""Whatever it is you have, we'll take it. We'll pull your driver's license. We'll take your title. We just don't have bad debt."" Lewis pauses a moment to consider his words, then shrugs, his point made: At the Massachusetts Registry, ""we walk a very fine line with incredible power over people.""

Increasingly, lawmakers around the country are employing that power to enforce public policies that have nothing to do with driving or motor vehicles. Lewis and his counterparts in other states aren't happy with the change, but there's little they can do when legislatures hand down new rules.

""Every governmental agency is looking for every means possible to...enforce the regulations and policies in front of it,"" says Barry Goleman, President of AAMVANET, a computer network run by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators that links together the computers of the United States's 51 motor vehicle agencies. And increasingly, says Goleman, those state agencies are turning towards the DMVs as a source of data about the state's citizens, a way of providing services, and ultimately, a means of enforcing policy."	-15.18
"What happens when a state with a tough voter ID law suddenly makes it much harder for minorities to get driver's licenses? We are about to find out in Alabama.

Facing a budget crisis, Alabama has shuttered 31 driver's license offices, many of them in counties with a high proportion of black residents. Coming after the state recently put into effect a tougher voter ID law, the closures will cut off access -- particularly for minorities -- to one of the few types of IDs accepted.

RELATED Alabama Will Reopen Closed DMV Offices in Black Counties

According to a tally by AL.com columnist John Archibald, eight of the 10 Alabama counties with the highest percentage of non-white registered voters saw their driver's license offices closed.

"On most topics, the mix of reader opinions in letters to the editor stays the same over time. Examples include climate change (most letter writers want more government action against it) and President Trump (is it really necessary for me to state what many of our readers think of him?).

For a select few topics, the prevailing reader opinion swings like a pendulum, often in response to other published letters that fall on one side of an issue. One example is gun control: Usually after a high-profile shooting, we’ll get inundated with submissions calling for new laws, after which gun-rights proponents reply to those letters.

Add to the second column another topic: the Department of Motor Vehicles. When there was a burst of news coverage recently of DMV customers waiting in line up to six hours, most of our letter writers complained of the lethargic bureaucracy they endured just to renew a driver’s license. Now, most of our DMV commentators are sharing tales of hardworking staff and easy, in-and-out appointments.

The takeaway? If a morning or afternoon at the DMV can put letter writers in a good mood, maybe there’s hope for humanity.

Temecula resident Steve Ross uses the word “beautiful” after his DMV experience:

The DMV is functioning just fine. All one really has to do is follow directions.

My visit there on Sept. 12 was to obtain a Real ID driver’s license. I followed the directions on the DMV website, which has three lists of documents; drivers are required to present an example from each list to obtain a Real ID license. Like the website says, it’s as easy as 1-2-3.

Yes, I spent two hours there, but it was great to see parents assisting their children in obtaining their driving privilege for the first time. Our beautiful California has a lot of people — we are blessed.

Jeanette Barcroft of Camarillo clocks her recent visit at less than an hour:

On Monday, I got a Real ID license. When I got my renewal notice, I went to the DMV website and looked up everything I needed.

I went in on my appointed day with all the required documentation at the ready and filled out an application at a computer there. Then I stood in the appointments-only line for about five minutes and was served right away by a series of helpful, hardworking people. Paperwork, vision test, knowledge test and photo all followed quickly, and I was done.

The whole process took 40 minutes. That was because I had an appointment and came prepared with everything I needed. However, the building was packed with people who did not do their homework. As I left I thanked the staff and praised their efforts, but I know their efficiency was partly due to mine.

Mickey Rivers of Lakewood says check-in is the DMV’s choke point:

I recently made an appointment at the Long Beach DMV to get a Real ID license. I got in the appointments queue and was the 11th person in line. Problem was, there was only one employee checking in both appointments and non-appointments, so it took me 55 minutes just to check in. This is an obvious flaw.

Once checked in, I was called within five minutes to have my documents verified. I was then directed to another window, where there was no wait to take a picture. I was then required to take both the motor vehicle and motorcycle written tests, for which I didn’t study in advance but passed in short order.

Once I checked in, everything took 20 minutes, and I was out the door with my temporary license.

It seems the DMV needs to speed up its check-in process, especially for customers with appointments. It would also help if everyone went to the DMV website and verified what documents they needed before showing up.

"One of the great issues in American politics, in hibernation for over 30 years, is poised to re-awaken. The issue is monopoly, and it hasn't been more relevant in over a century. Mergers and acquisitions have put a handful of bloated corporate behemoths in effective control of scores of American markets.

Anti-trust law, basically a dead letter since the Reagan administration, is making a comeback. It's time to start forcing business to compete again.

Monopoly is an inherent problem with capitalism driven by the obvious fact that businessmen don't like competition. No less than Adam Smith wrote: ""People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment or diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."" Best to have a captive population of customers who have nowhere else to turn.

What's more, as Brad DeLong has written, corporations are hierarchical command-and-control bureaucracies. Without external market discipline, they readily develop the same pathologies that often plague ineffective government agencies — indeed, they can easily be worse, since at least with government departments one can write to an elected official somewhere and complain. Going to the DMV is often a pain, but I'd much rather get my license renewed than try to get Verizon to fix a piece of broken equipment.

Poor customer service is also simply good business for a monopoly. When one has lots of market power, it makes sense to attempt first-degree price discrimination — that is, changing the price for each customer so as to charge them their absolute maximum willingness to pay. The way American telecom companies often do this is by constantly nudging up your price until you get annoyed enough to threaten to cancel your service. Then when you contact them, they make the process as onerous as possible so you're more likely to simply give up in disgust and eat the higher price. Sound familiar?

For many years, conservatives justified creeping monopolization by shifting the standards by which business consolidation was judged. Instead of simply insuring competition in all markets, as was the pre-Reagan standard, they demanded evidence that a merger would actually harm consumers. That is much more favorable terrain for business and their pet lawyers and economists.

But today, the results of monopoly are so patently horrible that even some conservatives are beginning to come around. David Dayen reports that in the first Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on anti-trust in several years, both Democrats and Republicans expressed serious reservations about excessive market consolidation. Last year was the biggest one ever for mergers and acquisitions, and conservative stalwart Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) worried that monopolization could taint seed supplies while Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) wondered if agencies were unprepared for yet another wave of consolidation:

Amazingly, Wednesday’s hearing showed that antitrust policy is not a partisan issue. It’s even become a point on the campaign trail: Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have stressed greater antitrust enforcement and breaking up monopolies, and while not specifically talking antitrust, Donald Trump wants to inject competition into the drug industry. But the pressure from Congress is even more encouraging, because it could be all it takes to spur the agencies to do their job. [New Republic]

The best solution here for both sides may be a return to the pre-Reagan regulatory tradition of simple rules of thumb rather than hellishly complex calculations of consumer welfare, as Kevin Drum argues. Conservatives often complain (with some justification) that government agencies are not very good at implementing complicated regulatory schemes. But you cannot have anti-trust without some sort of government agency to enforce the rules. And without such an agency, you can't have the competition that supposedly delivers the free market goods.

Rules like ""every major market must have at least five serious competitors"" or ""no company can acquire more than a 20 percent national market share"" can't be justified as being the best of all possible worlds (because nothing can), but they are easy to understand and enforce. Best of all, the anti-trust legal framework is still on the books from over a century ago. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department could simply decide to start enforcing the laws in the old way — especially if prodded by Congress.

At bottom, monopoly is a simple issue that virtually every citizen can grasp. Corporations want to get so big that they can dominate consumers and collect easy profits. It's obviously a huge problem today, as it has been in the past — as former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once said, ""In 1911 we broke up Standard Oil — so what happened? The individual parts became more valuable than the whole."" It's time to cut some monopolists down to size."	-15.18
"It's been over 10 months since Madonna questionably called COVID-19 ""the great equalizer,"" and her words continue to age like milk.

Nearly 20 million people in the U.S. have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine and 3.5 million have been fully vaccinated, with healthcare personnel, older adults, and other essential workers among the prioritized groups. But in some cases, all it takes is a little monetary gift to move to the top of the queue.

Overlake Medical Center & Clinics, a hospital outside of Seattle, Washington, found itself with 500 open vaccine slots — and it chose to send emails to its ""major"" donors offering the jab, The Seattle Times reports. The ""by invite"" only emails were reportedly sent to those who had given more than $10,000 to the hospital system, and they offered up slots during the last week of January.

Overlake decided to ""cut access to the exclusive appointments"" following a call from the office of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) Tuesday morning. Inslee later said the prioritization of a ""VIP list"" for vaccine appointments is ""not acceptable for us,"" adding that ""we've got to maintain public credibility in the system.""

The appointments were not solely offered to the list of over 100 donors, Overlake said, but were also presented to board members, patients, volunteers, employees, and retired health providers, per The Seattle Times. The medical center's chief operating officer Tom DeBord told The Times ""In hindsight, we could certainly look back and say this wasn't the best way to do it.""

The snafu at Overlake isn't an isolated event. Vaccine ""fast-passes"" have been distributed to members of the donor class in Florida, while wealthy non-donors have pestered doctors over whether a donation would boost their priority in the queue. The optics of the Overlake situation only add more fuel to the fire regarding the vaccine's velvet rope. Marianne Dodson"	-15.18

"County commissioners furious about Publix vaccine plan Commissioners cite racial disparity in numbers

Jane Musgrave | Palm Beach Post

Palm Beach County commissioners Tuesday lashed out at the governor’s decision to put Publix in charge of the county’s coronavirus vaccination program, calling his actions disgusting and insisting it will further complicate the already chaotic rollout.

“I’m absolutely, absolutely disgusted that the governor of this state has 100% taken the authority to administer the vaccination program out of the hands of the public health department and given that authority to a corporate entity,” said Commissioner Melissa McKinlay.

More: Which Publix stores in Palm Beach County are offering COVID-19 vaccines? Here's a list.

At McKinlay's insistence, commissioners agreed to write a letter to Gov. Ron DeSantis, expressing their dismay that the county health department is no longer getting an allotment of vaccines.

They also agreed to write a letter to the county’s congressional delegation, asking members to persuade federal health authorities to increase the number of doses being sent to the county.

Increasing the supply of the vaccine and relaxing the grocery giant’s grip on the vaccination program would help eliminate disturbing racial disparities, commissioners said.

Of the 123,789 people in the county who had received the first dose of the two-shot vaccine as of Tuesday, 71% are white. Only 2.8% are black and 3.4% are Hispanic, even though African-Americans represent nearly 20% of the county’s population and Latinos account for 23.4%.

“We have to redouble our efforts to make sure there is not this disparity,” said Vice Mayor Robert Weinroth. “We have to go out of our way to turn these numbers around.”

While 67 Publix stores in the county are offering vaccines to those over age 65, none is located in the county’s predominantly black cities, McKinlay said. She called these areas “vaccine deserts.”

The vaccines aren’t being offered at the Publix in Riviera Beach, and there is no Publix store in the rural, poverty-wracked Glades area, which has been hard hit by the pandemic.

“When you leave Loxahatchee Groves, you have to travel 108 miles to get to the next Publix on State Road 80,” McKinlay said of the highway that cuts through the Glades. Headed west, the next Publix is in Lehigh Acres in Lee County, she said.

She also bristled at DeSantis’ suggestion that seniors should write their U.S. senators and representatives to push for more vaccines.

“The governor of the state of Florida is the one who should be reaching out to the administration,” McKinlay said. “He should not be telling seniors to do it. I’m totally incensed right now.”

Further, she questioned why DeSantis is criticizing the Biden administration for the shortage and didn’t voice the same frustration when his Republican ally, President Donald Trump, was in office.

“(President Joe) Biden has been in office for six days,” said McKinlay, a Democrat. “Where the hell has the governor been since the vaccine became available six weeks ago?""

“So all of a sudden, since we’ve had a transfer of power, he realizes he has a vaccine distribution problem?” she said.

Since DeSantis has scoffed at Biden’s plan to dispatch the Federal Emergency Management Agency to administer the vaccine, she suggested the county try to countermand that decision.

She suggested writing a letter to federal officials, making it clear that even if DeSantis doesn’t want FEMA’S help, the county does.

During an early morning press conference to announce that additional Publix stores in Indian River and St. Lucie counties would begin offering vaccines, DeSantis said he would welcome FEMA's help if it meant the state would get more vaccines.

However, he said, the state has the ability to administer 500,000 shots a week if the federal government would send more than the 266,000 the state has been receiving weekly.

""All we want is more doses,"" he said.

DeSantis indicated that Palm Beach County officials supported his decision to put Publix in charge of the county’s vaccination program.

During a meeting two weeks ago with Mayor Dave Kerner and county leaders, DeSantis said, he discussed having Publix administer the vaccine.

“They said, ‘Yeah, bring that here. We think that would be good,’ ” DeSantis recalled. With 90% of the county's 400,000 senior citizens living within 1½ miles of a Publix, the plan was embraced, he said.

“It’s just a matter of what’s easier for folks,” DeSantis said.

But County Administrator Verdenia Baker, who was at the meeting with DeSantis, said the county didn't want Publix to become the sole provider. Mass vaccination sites are needed to inoculate seniors before the county can start offering shots to others.

Kerner, a Democrat who has praised the governor's handling of the pandemic, said people, including some of his fellow commissioners, are blaming DeSantis and Publix for the supply problems.

""They’re free to criticize whoever they want and that’s an important point of a democracy,"" he said after the meeting. ""But I am more of the operational mindset of putting one foot in front of another and making sure every important intergovernmental relationship I’m responsible for is strong, sincere, and supportive.”

Overall, the county has performed well, Kerner said. A larger percentage of Palm Beach County residents have been vaccinated than in Broward or Miami-Dade counties, according to the Florida Department of Health.

As of Monday, 8.7% of county residents had been vaccinated, compared to 5.7% in Miami-Dade and 6.4% in Broward County.

But that doesn't mean the people have been vaccinated in their home county. The state reports how many people in a county have been vaccinated regardless of where they got the shot, said Dr. Alina Alonso, the county's health director.

Still, Kerner credited Publix with helping Palm Beach County out-perform its more populous southern neighbors.

""Publix is a central reason why we’ve outpaced every (large) county in per capita vaccination rates,"" he said. ""I’m very thankful Gov. DeSantis selected our county to be the first large county recipient of the Publix support team.”

However, Alonso said, the Publix-only strategy will make it impossible for the county to launch its distribution plan when additional supplies of vaccines become available.

The plan calls for the establishment of mass vaccination sites at such locations as the South Florida Fairgrounds and FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches. Mobile units would be dispatched to vaccinate those in low-income areas, and municipal fire departments would offer vaccines to city residents.

Those plans have been scrapped since her agency has been told that its vaccines are being diverted to Publix, Alonso said.

While the county’s separate tax-funded health care district will continue to receive some doses, the amount has fallen dramatically, district officials said. After receiving 11,700 last week, they are expecting 975 this week, said Robin Kish, a spokeswoman for the district.

Both the health department and the health care district will continue to administer second doses to those who came to them for their first shot.

But, Alonso said, unless she receives a new shipment of vaccines, her agency will exhaust its supplies via appointments already scheduled through Feb. 2.

Also disturbing is the process Publix is using to schedule appointments, said Commissioner Gregg Weiss.

Many seniors have had difficulty navigating the online registration system. With as many as 300,000 people across the state logging on at once, it often freezes. In the two days last week when Publix offered online appointments, 73,100 people in 18 counties snapped them up.

Waking before dawn and trying to get an appointment has become a frustrating and fruitless ritual for many elderly people throughout the county, Weiss said.

“Instead of making this as easy as possible, we’ve set up a system that’s potentially going to cause more barriers for people,” he said.

Weinroth called it the ""whack-a-mole"" approach to appointment-making. ""People have been going in one direction and then rushing in another,’’ he said.

Tens of thousands of seniors, who spent hours registering to get the vaccine from the county health department, are now trying to get a vaccination from Publix.

Weinroth noted that seniors inundated cities — such as Delray Beach and Boca Raton — when Alonso gave them each 200 vaccines. The few Black churches that received vaccines from the state were also flooded with calls.

“We need to have one unified vaccination reservation system where people feel equity, feel fairness and feel that if they get on the list on a certain date, their place on the list will be preserved and someone is not going to jump ahead of them because a site opened up with a couple of hundred doses,"" Weinroth said.

The health care district is processing the remaining 73,000 emails seniors sent the health department to request appointments. If it continues to get vaccines, those on the wait list will continue to be scheduled for appointments, Kish said.

As supplies increase, it is likely more locations will become available, Baker said.

""When the vaccine starts to flow the way that it should, that’s just going to be another way to get it,” Baker said. “I don’t believe Publix is the sole solution for our needs. We’re too large of a county.”

"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18

WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Nancy Pelosi intensified pressure Thursday on House Republican leaders for their handling of a controversial GOP freshman, denouncing them for placing a lawmaker who Pelosi says has “mocked the killing of little children” on the chamber’s education committee.

Pelosi’s comments focused on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whose views were in the spotlight even before she joined the House this month. Greene supported Facebook posts that advocated violence against Democrats and the FBI. One suggested shooting Pelosi in the head. In response to a post raising the prospect of hanging former President Barack Obama, Greene responded that the “stage is being set.”

On Thursday, Pelosi referred to social media posts reported by Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog group, in which Greene pushed conspiracy theories or “liked” posts that challenged the veracity of mass shootings at schools in Newtown, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida.

“Assigning her to the education committee, when she has mocked the killing of little children” at those schools, “what could they be thinking, or is thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing,” Pelosi said of Republican leaders. “It’s absolutely appalling.”

While some Republicans have condemned Greene’s postings, they were hardly a surprise. The Georgia Republican has expressed support for QAnon conspiracy theories, which focus on the debunked belief that top Democrats are involved in child sex trafficking, Satan worship and cannibalism. Facebook videos surfaced last year showing she’d expressed racist, anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim views. Top Republicans denounced her at the time, hoping to block her from capturing the GOP nomination for her reliably red congressional district in northwest Georgia.

The opposition faded, however, when Greene won the primary and was essentially guaranteed a seat in Congress. By the time she was sworn into office, Greene had ridden with President Donald Trump on Air Force One during his final days in office.

Republican leaders are now confronting a conundrum of their own making. The party largely embraced Greene after she won the primary, making it harder for them to distance themselves from her, especially when many of her views were already well known.

The dynamic raises questions about the GOP’s ability — or interest — in moving past Trump-style politics after the former president spent years advancing conspiracy theories of his own .

“Trump didn’t hijack the party, the party became Donald Trump,” said Stuart Stevens, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a conservative group that staunchly opposes Trump. “They’re radicals.”

CNN reported on Greene’s Facebook posts, which have since been deleted. She tweeted responses before the story was published that didn’t dispute their authenticity or disavow them, saying instead: “Many posts have been liked. Many posts have been shared. Some did not represent my views.”

Still, there’s greater pressure on political leaders to address extremism after a pro-Trump mob staged a deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. California Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez announced Wednesday night that he was readying a resolution to expel Greene from Congress because of her past social media activity.

ADVERTISEMENT

In a statement to Axios, a spokesman for House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy called the posts “deeply disturbing” and said McCarthy “plans to have a conversation with the Congresswoman about them.”

It’s unclear when that conversation may happen. McCarthy flew to Florida on Thursday to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called the posts “disgusting,” adding that they have “no place in our party” and “should be looked into.”

But McDaniel also spoke to a QAnon issue that goes beyond Greene.

“I think it’s really important, after what’s just happened in our country, that we have some self reflection on the violence that’s continuing to erupt,” McDaniel said in an interview. “I think QAnon is beyond fringe. I think it’s dangerous. We should be looking at that and making sure we don’t mince words and when we say that we can’t support groups that are initiating violence.”

On Wednesday night, a reporter from WRCB-TV attempted to ask Greene about her social media posts during a public town hall in Dalton, Georgia. The reporter was kicked out of the event and threatened with arrest by a sheriff’s deputy.

Full Coverage: Politics

The Whitfield County Sheriff’s Office declined to comment and directed questions to Greene’s office. A spokesperson for Greene’s office said in a statement: “This was a town hall for constituents. Not a press conference.”

The FBI has called QAnon a domestic terrorism threat and the Department of Homeland Security issued a national terrorism bulletin Wednesday warning of the potential for lingering violence from extremists enraged by President Joe Biden’s election and emboldened by the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

Greene’s situation is somewhat reminiscent of former Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who was stripped of all his committee assignments by his own party’s House leadership after expressing support for white supremacists in 2019. National GOP groups shunned King in the party’s Iowa primary and he was defeated, but he steadfastly maintained that he was adhering to his constituents’ beliefs more than most of the rest of his party.

Greene’s online agitation goes beyond past Facebook posts — including making a video that falsely suggested the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting that killed 58 people was staged to advance gun control legislation.

Since winning her congressional seat, Greene has sought to capitalize on her growing national notoriety with conservatives, spending more than $206,000 to lure in new donors through Parler , a social media site favored by Trump supporters and right-wing extremists.

The site was effectively booted from the internet following the mayhem at the Capitol after Amazon, which hosted the site, decided Parler wasn’t doing enough to police users who incited violence. Before its removal, Greene’s spending super-charged her presence on Parler, with some of her posts reaching millions of users, according to an analysis of data by The Associated Press.

She frequently attacked Democrats and railed against coronavirus pandemic safety measures, like mask-wearing. Greene also called on Congress to overturn the results of Biden’s election.

“I’m tired of seeing weak-kneed Republicans play defense. I will go on the attack,” Greene said in a Nov. 18 post. “It’s our 1776 moment!” she posted the day before the mob overran the Capitol.

“You have members of Congress who do not feel safe at work right now because of the violent attempted coup,” said Melissa Ryan, CEO of consultancy group Card Strategies, which researches online disinformation and right-wing extremism. “And then you have politicians like Marjorie Taylor Greene who are not just stoking the fear, but using it as a fundraising tool.”

Greene is now texting supporters, seeking to raise money for her attempt to “impeach Biden.” The fine print of her solicitations, however, shows that any funds she takes in will instead be routed to her campaign account.

"CNN on Tuesday unveiled examples of Greene’s past social media activity from as recently as 2019 that appeared to endorse executing Democrats and federal law enforcement officers. She was reported to have liked one comment that said “a bullet to the head would be quicker” to get rid of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

“Such advocacy for extremism and sedition not only demands her immediate expulsion from Congress, but it also merits strong and clear condemnation from all of her Republican colleagues, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,” Gomez said in a statement on Wednesday evening.

He continued: “Her very presence in office represents a direct threat against the elected officials and staff who serve our government, and it is with their safety in mind, as well as the security of institutions and public servants across our country, that I call on my House colleagues to support my resolution to immediately remove Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from this legislative body.”

In a statement to POLITICO Thursday morning, Greene said: “Democrats and their spokesmen in the Fake News Media will stop at nothing to defeat conservative Republicans.""

In response to CNN’s reporting earlier this week, Greene tweeted out a lengthy diatribe Tuesday where claimed that she’d had “teams of people” managing her social media accounts and that some posts “did not represent my views.” She then went on berate CNN as “Fake News.”

Gomez had previously called for Greene’s removal from the House after a violent mob of rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a siege that resulted in the deaths of at least five people. Several rioters said they were motivated to attack by then-President Donald Trump’s monthslong campaign to discredit the results of the 2020 election. Greene, who is an ardent Trump supporter, went on to join the majority of the Republican caucus in voting to challenge the election results, even though election officials and courts across the country have refuted claims of widespread irregularities and fraud.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this article mischaracterized Marjorie Taylor Greene's reported social media activity."	-15.18

"President Trump and his congressional allies in his attempt to reject the results of the 2020 presidential election are responsible for the chaos in the Capitol on Wednesday.

They are not solely responsible, for the rioters bear responsibility, too. But Wednesday's violence would not have happened without two months of delusion and deception from the president and self-serving enablement from members of Congress like Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), and dozens of others. Their behavior was not sufficient to produce this madness, but it was certainly necessary. The storming of the Capitol is the result of ""humoring him."" It is not the worst-case scenario, but it is bad, and lives may yet be lost as a result.

Complicit Republicans should be held responsible. I do not think they will be.

Their first line of defense has already been deployed: Statements denouncing violence are going up all over the place. ""This is wrong and not who we are,"" says Donald Trump Jr. ""Those storming the Capitol need to stop NOW,"" says Cruz. ""The violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now,"" says Vice President Mike Pence. ""POTUS wants you to EXPRESS YOUR OPINION PEACEFULLY, We are the law and order party,"" says presidential attorney Rudy Giuliani, who had called for ""trial by combat"" several hours prior. ""The violence must end,"" says Hawley, who raised a fist in solidarity with the demonstrators before the Capital was breached.

This is all very correct, Trump Jr.'s statement excluded. And all the Trumpy Republicans now issuing these denunciations will duly point to them for months to come. ""I opposed it at the time!"" they'll protest. ""I would never support political violence. I would never undermine our hallowed system of representative government. I love America. I love our Constitution."" You know the drill. They'll fall back on all those tropes, pointing over and over to the time stamps on their tweets. ""I opposed it at the time!""

Sure, okay. Maybe these rejections of violence are even sincere (though phrasing from Ivanka Trump and Giuliani rather undercuts that case). But this is undeniably happening because these very Republicans played along with mass hysteria to benefit themselves. They indulged unfounded feelings and fostered confusion and, yes, undermined our system of representative government. The circumstances in Washington would be very different right now if, as acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney infamously forecast in the Wall Street Journal, Trump had conceded graciously — or even if he hadn't, but the rest of the GOP had united against his lies. They did not, and no amount of tweeted critique of violence will change that history. They are right to condemn the violence, but they should also own their part in it. I'm not sure there's anything prosecutable in their behavior (I don't think incitement would be provable), but they should certainly suffer loss of office and reputation.

As pessimistic as I am about that prospect, I'm even more bearish on the chances of Trump himself taking responsibility. He reportedly resisted asking his supporters to go home — was he waiting to see if they'd somehow win? — and when he finally did so in a video message, he continued to reiterate the very election fraud lie that brought them out to the streets of Washington in the first place. It was not the statement of a man prepared to accept responsibility. Trump poured fuel and water on the fire in equal measure. ""We love you,"" he told the rioters. ""You're very special.""

Calls are increasing, including in conservative corners, for Trump to be relieved of his duties via the 25th Amendment, or impeached and removed, or even prosecuted once he is out of office. That's all to the good — I say as someone who would have favored going after him (and indeed most presidents) for war crimes while he was still in office — but I'm not sure we should get our hopes up.

The Republican establishment and millions of normie Republicans would have to want this for it to happen. But if they say Trump is responsible, they open the door to similar consequences for other Republicans, like Cruz and Hawley, whom they'd like to keep in office. And if the last five years are any indication, given a choice between responsibility and power, they will choose power."	-15.18

"It made a difference. Kalmoe found that among “citizens with aggressive personality traits” support for political violence “doubled when exposed to political messages infused with violent metaphors.” What’s shocking about Kalmoe’s findings is that the language in the violent ads is so weak. In America today, calling a political contest a “fight” or a “battle” is what George Orwell called a “dying metaphor”: a metaphor that has been so overused that it no longer conjures a visual image. When a politician says he’s going to “fight” to improve the economy, no one imagines people punching each other. Yet even this extremely mild form of violent speech increases support for violence in some people.

Obviously, showing that a hypothetical ad can make people more willing to endorse violence is far from showing that any particular political statement incited James Hogdkinson to open fire in Alexandria. Still, Kalmoe’s research suggests it may matter that Hogdkinson belonged to a Facebook group called “Terminate the Republican Party.” It certainly suggests America would be better off if politicians used fewer martial metaphors.

Only in a country like the United States, where war is overwhelmingly something that happens in far-off lands, can leaders so easily deploy phrases like the “war on poverty” and the “war on Christmas.” Imagine the absurdity of a Syrian or Iraqi politician using such a phrase. At the least, violent metaphors desensitize Americans to the horror of actual violence. At worst, they make such violence more likely.

According to Kalmoe, language that isn’t explicitly violent but “dehumanizes the other side or emphasizes the extremity of provocation by others” may make people more prone to violence too. Such language, he told me, can produce a “moral disengagement that allows people to justify to themselves acts that they wouldn’t otherwise think are moral or ethical.” A recent article in Vox, for instance, cited research by Stanford’s Albert Bandura noting that when people in a study heard researchers calling another study participant “an animal,” they became more likely to give that person a “painful shock.” That’s why Donald Trump’s reference last year to refugees as “animals” was so dangerous. Calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” isn’t a great idea either.

What’s tricky is determining where legitimate moral outrage shades into dehumanization. Calling Donald Trump’s actions “deplorable” is probably fine. Calling him “deplorable” is a bit more problematic. Placing “half” of his supporters in a “basket of deplorables,” as Hillary Clinton infamously did last fall, is worse.

But as Ta-Nehisi Coates argued at the time, her comments were factually defensible. Three-quarters of Trump supporters backed banning Muslims from entering the United States. Forty percent believed that African Americans are “more violent, more criminal, lazier, and ruder than whites.”

At a time when America’s president, with widespread Republican support, dehumanizes some of the most vulnerable people in the country, how do progressives express their moral fury without embracing a dehumanizing language of their own? Before Wednesday, many liberals may not have considered that an urgent question. Now they have no excuse."	-15.18
"Famous line from a Patrick Henry speech in 1775

""Give me liberty, or give me death!"" is a quotation attributed to Patrick Henry from a speech he made to the Second Virginia Convention on March 23, 1775,[1] at St. John's Church in Richmond, Virginia.

""Give me liberty, or give me death!"", lithograph (1876) from the Library of Congress

Henry is credited with having swung the balance in convincing the convention to pass a resolution delivering Virginian troops for the Revolutionary War. Among the delegates to the convention were future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.

Publication [ edit ]

The speech was not published until The Port Folio printed a version of it in 1816.[2] The version of the speech that is known today first appeared in print in Sketches of the Life and Character of Patrick Henry, a biography of Henry by William Wirt in 1817.[2] There is debate among historians as to whether and to what extent Henry or Wirt should be credited with authorship of the speech and its famous closing words.[2][3]

Reception [ edit ]

According to Edmund Randolph, the convention sat in silence for several minutes afterward. Thomas Marshall told his son John Marshall, who later became Chief Justice of the United States, that the speech was ""one of the boldest, vehement, and animated pieces of eloquence that had ever been delivered.""[4] Edward Carrington, who was listening outside a window of the church, requested to be buried on that spot. In 1810, he got his wish.

The drafter of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, George Mason, said, ""Every word he says not only engages but commands the attention, and your passions are no longer your own when he addresses them.""[4] More immediately, the resolution, declaring the United Colonies to be independent of the Kingdom of Great Britain, was passed, and Henry was named as chairman of the committee assigned to build a militia.

Britain's royal governor, Lord Dunmore, reacted by seizing the gunpowder in the public magazine at Williamsburg, Virginia's equivalent of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.[4]

Whatever the exact words of Henry were, ""scholars, understandably, are troubled by the way Wirt brought into print Henry's classic Liberty or Death speech,"" wrote the historian Bernard Mayo. ""Yet... its expressions... seemed to have burned themselves into men's memories. Certainly, its spirit is that of the fiery orator who in 1775 so powerfully influenced Virginians and events leading to American independence.""[4]

Precursors [ edit ]

There had been similar phrases used preceding Henry's speech. The 1713 play, Cato, a Tragedy, was popular in the American Colonies and well known by the Founding Fathers, who quoted from the play. George Washington had the play performed for the Continental Army at Valley Forge.[5] It contains the line, ""It is not now time to talk of aught/But chains or conquest, liberty or death"" (Act II, Scene 4). The phrase ""Liberty or Death"" also appears on the Culpeper Minutemen flag of 1775.[6]

The opera Artemisia (1657) has an aria called Dammi morte o libertà (""Give me death or freedom"") but the context is different since in the aria, ""freedom"" is not meant political freedom. Oronta is asking Amor, the personification of love, to free her from love's bonds or to kill her since love's pains are too hard for her to suffer. That is explained in the first stanza (""Give me death or freedom / Oh blind Amor, that so much sufferings, / So much troubles, so much chains / the heart can't bear"").

In Handel's 1746 oratorio Judas Maccabeus, the hero sings, ""Resolve, my sons, on liberty or death.""

""Liberty or death"" in other contexts [ edit ]

Phrases equivalent to liberty or death have appeared in a variety of other places:

The national anthem of Uruguay, ""Orientales, la Patria o la Tumba"", contains the line ¡Libertad o con gloria morir! (""Liberty or with glory to die!"").[7]

The national anthem of Chile, ""Canción Nacional"", contains the line Que o la tumba serás de los libres / O el asilo contra la opresión (""That you will be either the tomb of the free or an asylum from oppression"").

The 1320 Declaration of Arbroath made in the context of Scottish independence was a letter to the Pope that contained the line ""It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom – for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself"". It is commonly cited as an inspiration for the US Declaration of Independence by many, including the US Senate,[8] and it is possible that Henry knew of the Declaration when he wrote his speech.

The motto of Greece is ""Liberty or Death"" (Eleftheria i thanatos). It arose during the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s, when it was a war cry for Greeks who rebelled against Ottoman rule.[9]

A popular and possibly-concocted story in Brazil relates that in 1822, Emperor Pedro I uttered the famous ""Cry from [the river] Ipiranga"", ""Independence or Death"" (Independência ou Morte), when Brazil was still a colony of Portugal.[10]

During the Russian Civil War, the flag used by Nestor Makhno's anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine had the dual slogans ""Liberty or Death"" and ""The Land to the Peasants, the Factories to the Workers"".[11]

In March 1941, the motto of the public demonstrations in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia against the signing of a treaty with Nazi Germany was ""Better grave than slave"" (Bolje grob nego rob).[12]

During the Indonesian National Revolution, the Pemuda (""Youth"") used the phrase Merdeka atau Mati (""Freedom or Death"").[13]

In the 1964 speech ""The Ballot or the Bullet"" in Cleveland, Ohio, Malcolm X said, ""It'll be ballots, or it'll be bullets. It'll be liberty, or it will be death. The only difference about this kind of death -- it'll be reciprocal.""[14]

In 2012, in China, Ren Jianyu, a 25-year-old former college student ""village official,"" was given a two-year re-education through labor sentence for an online speech against the Communist Party of China. A T-shirt of Ren saying ""Give me liberty or give me death!"" (in Chinese) has been taken as evidence of his antisocial guilt.[15]

"This weekend we celebrate the Fourth of July, high holiday of American civic religion and universal occasion for cookouts, stars-and-stripes bikinis, and raucous displays of unbridled patriotism.

More than 200 years ago, however, there was no such unanimity on the subject of the American Revolution. Though our popular history tends to avoid such off-message details, about 15 percent of white American colonists during the Revolutionary War were loyalists, and perhaps more surprisingly, close to half were effectively neutral.

Prominent among the neutral colonists were pacifist Christians — mostly Quakers and various types of German Anabaptists and Baptists — who declined to fight on theological grounds. Though they were typically not loyal to England, these churches refused to join the Revolution, rejecting violent conflict even when waged in the name of liberty.

""[W]e have dedicated ourselves to Serve all Men in every Thing that can be helpful to the Preservation of Men's lives, but we find no Freedom in giving, or doing, or assisting in any Thing by which Men's lives are destroyed or hurt,"" declared a group of Mennonite elders and teachers in November of 1775, in a letter thanking the Pennsylvania Assembly for exempting them from conscription if they paid a fine or found a willing substitute.

Likely aware of the persecution — including imprisonment, confiscation of property, and rough treatment — that would await some of their number as war fervor swelled in the coming months, the elders added, ""We beg the Patience of all those who believe we err in this Point.""

Though the colonial governments generally urged tolerance towards the pacifist churches, Tories and Patriots alike were suspicious of those who would neither fight nor swear loyalty to one cause or the other. When incarceration was not forthcoming, mob attack too often arrived instead.

Ironically, given the revolutionaries' numerous tax-focused grievances, the Quakers were a particular target of mistrust because they would not pay taxes to support the war effort. (""No taxation without representation, except you definitely have to pay taxes to fund our militias whether you want this war or not"" would have made a less catchy slogan, I guess.)

The pacifist perspective on the Revolution goes all but unheard today, as patriotic hymns are queued up for this Sunday's service. Indeed, for many American Christians, the rightness of the Revolution — a conflict between two majority Christian armies that, in the general way of war, valued wealth and power above love and unity — goes without question. With President John Quincy Adams, much of the modern American church affirms in deed if not in word that, after Christmas, Independence Day is our ""most joyous and most venerated festival,"" a day to celebrate what is perceived as a major accomplishment in God's plan for the world.

The trouble is that the pacifist churches were right. As theologian Greg Boyd has asked, ""How can a holiday that celebrates one group of mostly professing Christians violently overthrowing another group of mostly professing Christians be venerated by people who are called to love their enemies and to be peacemakers, even if they happen to find themselves on the side that won?""

That's not to say that I wish we were British or even that I won't watch any fireworks. America is my home. I'm thankful to live in a nation that from the start has placed a historically high value on freedom and individual rights, and I, too, object to taxation without representation. As a libertarian, my views on the appropriate role of government are almost certainly closer than average to the classical liberalism of the Founding Fathers that Independence Day commemorates.

But it is to say that I can't celebrate, even indirectly, the unknown tens of thousands of deaths that were the price of independence. In this I am following in the footsteps — admittedly with far less personal risk — of the Quakers and Anabaptists who refused to cause those same casualties.

It isn't that I dislike America, but that its claims on my allegiance are a very distant second to the claims of a different sort of Kingdom altogether. For the Kingdom which Jesus came to establish is fundamentally not of this world. It is marked by peace among people of all nationalities, and a freedom guaranteed not by declaration and war but by the work of Christ. America has a lot of good points, to be sure, but it is not identical to and cannot compete with the Kingdom of God.

And the Fourth of July, inspired by the soaring (if unequally applied) rhetoric of the Declaration of Independence, may rank pretty highly as political holidays go, but there is nothing particularly Christian about it. Certainly Christians can enjoy fireworks with our friends this weekend, but we would do well to view the whole affair through ""Kingdom lenses,"" recalling that these sparklers burn in celebration of a ""Thing by which Men's lives [were] destroyed."""	-15.18
"Nathan Kalmoe is assistant professor of political communication at Louisiana State University in the Manship School of Mass Communication and Department of Political Science.

Over the past week, a gunman targeted an African-American church in Kentucky in what is being investigated as a hate crime; another shooter, shouting ant-Semitic epithets, killed 11 people at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a third man mailed 14 pipe bombs to Democratic ex-presidents, members of Congress and other critics of President Donald Trump. After this spate of violence, many Americans are wondering whether the president’s hostile political rhetoric—attacking “globalists,” minorities, the media and Democratic “mobs”—contributed to the attacks; Democrats are accusing him of direct incitement, while some Republicans, including the White House, call that idea absurd.

What does social and psychological research tell us about the potential link between political rhetoric and violence? Can words really lead to actions? Cause and effect are hard to establish conclusively, especially in individual cases. But researchers have good circumstantial evidence from the real world as well as evidence from scientific experiments concluding, overall, that rhetoric is probably not the main cause in most attacks—but violent, hateful language can inflame people who are already inclined toward violence and focus their rage.

In a series of experiments I conducted in 2010, I found that exposure to mildly violent political metaphors such as “fighting for our future” increased general support for political violence among people with aggressive personalities.

After participants answered personality questions about aggression, I randomly assigned them to read a short campaign speech that included either violent metaphors or nonviolent substitutes. Then, participants responded to questions about political threats, property damage and physical violence against leaders. Among interpersonally aggressive people, those who read the violent text had higher average political violence scores compared with those who saw nonviolent language. People with low aggressive personality scores were unaffected by language differences. In other words, aggressive people are already more likely to support political violence, and violent language makes them more so. The mild metaphors I used in these studies match well with common political language, so the explicit violent language we have heard recently could have stronger effects.

My findings are consistent with other research about how media violence primes aggressive behavior in people who are predisposed to it. What’s more, perpetrators of political violence, most of whom are men, often have histories of interpersonal violence and domestic abuse.

We also have evidence that Trump’s own words have caused audiences to behave worse in the past. In national experiments from 2016 and 2017, University of Massachusetts political scientist Brian Schaffner found that exposure to Trump’s racist comments about Mexicans during his campaign made people more likely to write offensive statements that were toward not just Mexicans but other groups. Indeed, people with prejudices toward one group often dislike other groups, suggesting that bigoted language has consequences beyond targeted groups. Furthermore, people whose racial and religious identities align with the demographics of their political party are more hostile toward partisan opponents, as Lilliana Mason, of the University of Maryland, College Park shows in her book.

Thankfully, the vast majority of Americans reject violence in politics entirely. This was the case in the 1990s and in my 2010 studies. More recently, in 2017, Mason and I fielded a national survey that found similarly low levels of support for partisan violence, even when participants reported intense partisan hostility in other questions. And even among those who hold violent views, very few act on them. Of course, as we’ve seen, even a few people can do horrible damage.

Vilification in general makes it easier to harm people without damaging one’s good self-image, a process psychologists call “moral disengagement.” Vilifying rhetoric has contributed to mass violence and even genocide when weaponized against minority groups, as in Nazi Germany, and in Rwanda and the Balkans during the 1990s. This campaign season, the president and other Republicans have praised violence against journalists, described refugees as violent monsters, and promoted cynical conspiracy theories combining anti-Semitism, racism and unfounded fears of election fraud. Political scientist Erin Cassese, of the University of Delaware, has found that partisan dehumanization is common in campaigns, too.

Of course, violent rhetoric and demonization are not new in politics. The American founders accused one other of treason in partisan newspapers. Yale historian Joanne Freeman’s recent book, Field of Blood, documents how vitriolic rhetoric between 19th-century congressmen caused dozens of brawls before the Civil War. Hyperpartisan vitriol, conspiracy-mongering and threats led directly to the war itself—the nation’s bloodiest. Extreme rhetoric also coincided with real violence in the political turmoil of the 1960s and 70s—assassinations and hundreds of bombings. More recently, we have witnessed several abortion clinic attacks, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the 2017 shooting of the Republican congressional baseball team, brawls at political events, Islamist-inspired attacks and scores of violent hate crimes. The Secret Service and FBI investigate hundreds of threats against leaders each year, along with recurring assassination attempts.

What’s new is violent, demonizing rhetoric directly from a president. That’s alarming because he has the country’s loudest megaphone, which has brought extreme language and views into mainstream politics. Consider that multiple people charged with crimes, or their lawyers, have recently pointed to Trump’s words as bearing some responsibility for their own acts.

We might usefully distinguish between a general climate fueling violent hate and more detailed inspirations for violence. Both are worrisome. But naming specific individuals and groups as “enemies of the people” focuses ire on specific targets. American leaders and citizens singled out in this way have subsequently received deluges of hateful, bigoted and violent messages. It is no surprise to see the next step into physical violence against those targets, with perpetrators spouting the same rhetoric.

The president is not alone in this language. Fox News and far-right websites alternately lead the president, then follow. Other politicians either share or parrot those views. That echo chamber expands the audience and reinforces the animosity by creating the impression of party consensus against certain “enemies.” Partisan citizens generally take their opinion cues from these party leaders. True, Trump has denounced hate and violence on occasion, but he subsequently undercuts his denunciations. Heated rhetoric by Democratic leaders, while it certainly exists, comes nowhere close.

Of course, conflict is inherent in politics, and leaders have a responsibility to criticize opponents to inform the public. Anger can have a mobilizing effect and can drive desirable, nonviolent political action—even contentious protest—but it’s also the emotional fuel of aggression.

Ultimately, leaders bear responsibility for protecting the peace and upholding norms necessary for a healthy democracy. There may not be legal consequences for violent, hateful words from the nation’s highest officials—and violence against them is out of the question—but we can ensure that they face electoral consequences when they channel violent prejudices."	-15.18

"Op-Ed

President-elect Joe Biden is already working hard to sell his ambitious plan to get people back to work and help the economy heal from the pandemic recession. It’s too bad the plan includes a key element that would get in the way: a $15 federal minimum wage that would slow the recovery and devastate many low-wage workers.

Few policy issues are as charged as the minimum wage, with supporters and opponents alike making extreme arguments. A $15 hourly wage floor would not immediately lead to massive inflation or the abolition of entry-level jobs. Likewise, it is not a free lunch, helping some workers and harming none. Like all significant policy changes, it would create winners and losers.

It’s a slam-dunk case that doubling the federal minimum wage — it’s been $7.25 since 2009 — would lead to significant declines in employment opportunities for workers with few skills or little experience. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2019 (before the pandemic), in 47 states, at least one-quarter of all workers earn less than $15 per hour. In 20 states, half of all workers earn less than $18 per hour, and in 30 states, the median hourly wage is less than $19.

These statistics show that $15 is a very high wage floor. For employers to keep all their workers would require raising the wages of a huge share of the national workforce. But the number of workers affected would be so large that this wouldn’t happen. Instead, the number of jobs in the low-wage workforce would shrink.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirms this basic intuition, estimating that joblessness would increase by 1.3 million if the national hourly wage floor were hiked to $15. The CBO also concluded that this policy would reduce business income, raise consumer prices and reduce gross domestic product.

Even in high-wage localities, a $15 hourly minimum would reduce employment. Seattle was a pioneer in the Fight for $15, committing in June 2014 to gradually raise its wage floor to that level. Its minimum wage increased from $9.47 to as high as $11 in 2015, and up to $13 in 2016 for large employers.

Using detailed government data, a team of economists estimated that the second wage increase to $13 reduced hours worked in the low-wage labor market by around 9%. Wages increased by less than hours decreased, so the hike to $13 reduced the earnings of low-wage workers by an average of $125 per month. In a subsequent paper, these economists found that the gains from the wage hike accrued to more experienced workers.

Opponents of hiking the wage floor often argue of dire consequences for even modest wage hikes. But following such increases, many observers conclude that the doomsday scenarios never materialized. This is not necessarily an indication that minimum wages don’t reduce employment.

To see why, imagine that you are drinking a cup of coffee. In between each sip, I add a tiny amount of sugar to your cup. You may not be able to tell whether your current sip is sweeter than the one immediately prior, because I am only adding a small amount of sugar each time. But your coffee will be a whole lot sweeter when you finish than when you started.

Something similar may be happening in the job market for workers with few skills. Don’t focus on the effects of a single modest increase. Instead, look at the big picture. At the end of 2019 (again, before the virus wrecked the economy), only 4 in every 10 high-school dropouts over the age of 24 had a job. Compare this with 6 out of 10 high-school graduates and 7 out of 10 college grads.

This represents a failure by society as a whole, and there are many reasons for it. But part of the blame rests with labor market regulations like the minimum wage. The accumulated effect of decades of a binding wage floor has probably priced many workers with relatively few skills out of the labor market. And because it happens gradually, it is hard for economists to measure the longer-term effect of any single increase.

Biden hasn’t announced any details, but surely he would want to take the federal minimum wage up to $15 over a period of years. That would be better than an abrupt increase, but would still cause damage. In addition, and as my research with economist Peter Brummund suggests, businesses may cut employment more aggressively when they know future wage-floor hikes are coming.

Eight states and the District of Columbia have already put their minimum wage on a path to $15, including large and prosperous states like California, Illinois and New York. This trend would soften the blow from a $15 national wage floor. But more importantly, it should reduce the urgency of minimum wage proponents. It would be better to see how these state experiments play out before the federal government increases the wage floor in, say, Mississippi, Arkansas and West Virginia — each of which had a median wage below $16.50 in 2019.

All that said, raising the federal minimum wage to $15 would have some upside. The same CBO report that found this policy would eliminate over one million jobs also concluded that at least 17 million workers would see their weekly earnings increase. Most of those gains would go to families with incomes above the poverty line.

So that’s the trade-off: Is boosting middle-class income worth eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs for the least-skilled, least-experienced, most vulnerable workers in the labor market? My answer is an emphatic no.

Biden has the right goal in mind. Last Thursday, when announcing this policy, he said: “No one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.” This is fundamentally a moral argument, not an economic one. And I agree.

Those who want to achieve this goal through the minimum wage are implicitly arguing that the burden of lifting up the working poor should fall to the businesses that employ them, along with their customers. This lets many high-income Americans who infrequently cross paths with the low-wage labor market off the hook.

Earnings subsidies, like the earned-income tax credit, are a better way to lift low-income workers out of poverty in part because they are financed with tax revenue. They use resources from all of society — not just low-wage employers and their customers — to achieve a social goal.

By increasing the financial rewards from working, they also increase employment among low-income households.

Biden wants to fight poverty. In the wake of the pandemic, he also wants to get more people back to work. Earnings subsidies would do both. A $15 minimum wage would reduce employment.

Mr. President-elect, fight for workers. Don’t fight for $15."	-15.18
"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said Wednesday that he’s discussing with colleagues whether a censure resolution to condemn former President Donald Trump for his role in the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol could be an alternative to impeachment, even as the Senate proceeds with a trial.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said the impeachment trial will move forward. But Kaine’s proposal is an acknowledgement that the Senate is unlikely to convict Trump of inciting the riot, a troubling prospect for many lawmakers who believe Trump must be held accountable in some way for the Capitol attack. If he were convicted, the Senate could then hold a second vote to ban him from office.

A censure would not hold the power of a conviction, but it would put the Senate on record as disapproving of Trump’s role in the insurrection, which came as Congress was counting electoral votes to confirm Democrat Joe Biden’s victory. Just before Trump’s supporters broke through windows and busted through the Capitol’s doors, he gave a fiery speech outside the White House urging them to “fight like hell” to overturn his defeat.

Talk of finding a punishment that more senators could rally around flared a day after just five Republicans joined Democrats in a Senate test vote over the legitimacy of Trump’s trial. It was unclear, though, whether other Democrats, or any Republicans, would sign on to Kaine’s proposal. House Democrats are busy preparing their formal case against the former president for inciting an insurrection, with arguments starting the week of Feb. 8.

“Make no mistake — there will be a trial, and the evidence against the former president will be presented, in living color, for the nation and every one of us to see,” Schumer said Wednesday.

An angry mob of Trump supporters wanting to stop Congress’ confirmation of Biden’s victory invaded the Capitol, ransacking hallways and offices and attempting to break into the House chamber with lawmakers hiding inside. They rifled through desks on the empty Senate floor and hunted for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, who was in the Capitol overseeing the certification of Biden’s election victory.

A week later, on Jan. 13, the Democratic-led House impeached Trump with the backing of 10 Republicans. The case was sent to the Senate on Monday.

Kaine, a Virginia senator, told reporters Wednesday that he has been talking to a “handful” of his colleagues for the last two weeks about the likelihood that Democrats would fall short of convicting Trump. A conviction would need the support of two-thirds of the senators, or 67 votes. Getting there would require all Democrats and 17 Republicans.

Kaine noted that the Senate is spending time on impeachment when it could be working to advance coronavirus relief, a major priority for Democrats and Biden.

Tuesday’s vote was “completely clarifying that we’re not going to get near 67,” Kaine said. “So, I think there’s maybe a little more interest now and then could this be an alternative.”

He added: “Obviously, we do a trial, maybe we can do it fast, but my top priority is COVID relief and getting the Biden Cabinet approved.”

Later in the day, Kaine said on CNN that the resolution would say the attack “was an insurrection and that President Trump gave aid and comfort to the insurrectionists.” He said it would also bar Trump from future office, though it is unclear if such a vote would be enforceable.

Sen. Susan Collins, one of the five Republicans who voted with Democrats on holding the trial, said she has been talking with Kaine about ways to hold Trump to account for his role in the riot.

“The question is, Is there another way to express condemnation of the president’s activities?” Collins said. She said that five is probably “

While many Republicans criticized Trump after the riot, passions have cooled since then. Now a number of Republicans are rushing to his legal defense.

The procedural motion from Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, defeated on a 45-55 vote, sought to declare the trial unconstitutional because Trump is no longer in office. It’s an argument that many legal scholars dispute but that most of the GOP caucus has leaned into, enabling Republicans to oppose the trial without directly defending Trump’s behavior.

Some said the censure resolution was too late because Democrats had rejected GOP suggestions of censure before the House voted to impeach.

Asked about Kaine’s idea, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said it would be a bad precedent to set. “I guess if we can censure former presidents, then when Republicans get in charge, we can censure Barack Obama or Democrats can censure George Bush.”

Some Democrats also appear wary.

Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said doing censure after impeachment is “possible, but I don’t know how much time that involves” and how it would work. He said there were “a lot of questions to be answered” about the idea.

Earlier Wednesday, on the Senate floor, Durbin criticized Republicans who want to dismiss the trial as he marked the three weeks that have passed since the attack.

“I’ll never forget it,” he said. “Do the 45 senators who voted against the impeachment trial last night still remember it? I certainly hope they do.”

It’s unclear if any Republicans who voted in favor of Paul’s motion would now vote to convict Trump on the actual charge of incitement. Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio voted for Paul’s motion but said after the vote that he had not made up his mind about conviction and that constitutionality “is a totally different issue” than the charge itself.

Many others indicated that they believe the final vote on Trump’s conviction will be similar to the 55-45 tally. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump ally, said he thinks the vote was “a floor, not a ceiling.”

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who has said Trump “provoked” the riots and who has indicated he is open to conviction, voted with Paul to move toward dismissing the trial.

Asked about his vote Wednesday, McConnell said the trial hasn’t started yet. “And I intend to participate in that and listen to the evidence,” he said."	-15.18

"Republicans close to former Vice President Mike Pence say they don't know where he's living.

Pence and his wife, Karen, haven't owned a home in a decade.

Indiana GOP sources say the former second couple is couch surfing while between jobs.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The speakers set up on the tarmac of the Columbus Municipal Airport belted out the Hoosier State's unofficial song — ""Back Home Again in Indiana"" — when Mike Pence landed there last week for the first time since he became a former vice president.

""I've already promised Karen we'll be moving back to Indiana come this summer,"" Pence told the assembled crowd in his hometown that's a little less than an hour's drive south of Indianapolis. ""There's no place like home.""

But careful Pence watchers couldn't help noticing he never said where ""home"" would be.

""He doesn't have a home, he doesn't have anywhere to live,"" one advisor to former President Donald Trump told Insider.

The Trump advisor is one of a dozen Republicans close with Pence's inner circle who were vexed that a former vice president of the United States would have neither a home nor a job. Some even wondered whether the Pences were couch surfing.

According to one source, the Pences are staying at the dolled-up cabin nearby that the Indiana governor uses as a retreat. If so, they'd need permission to spend the night from Pence's former lieutenant governor, Eric Holcomb, who now serves as governor.

Two Republicans close to the Pences said they heard the couple was staying at Pence's brother's place in Columbus.

The one thing everyone is certain of is that when the Pences moved out of the vice president's residence at the US Naval Observatory in Washington, they had nowhere to go. The former second couple doesn't actually own a house.

'Home-less'

The Pences haven't owned a home in a decade. Domicile hopping, in fact, has long been part of their lives as Pence charted a course from conservative talk-radio host to vice president.

In 1987, after a trip to see the local Republican kingmaker in Indianapolis, Mike and Karen Pence sold their modest single-family home near Butler University so they could move farther south into what was then Indiana's 2nd Congressional District.

In 1999, after Pence decided to make his third and ultimately first successful run for Congress, the couple moved again from Indianapolis. They bought a single-family home about an hour's drive south in Edinburgh, Indiana, inside the redrawn boundaries of the state's 2nd District, which he went on to represent.

After Pence won his 2000 race for Congress, the Pences lived in Washington for about a decade before returning full time to Indiana to run for governor. But instead of moving back to the Edinburgh home they had left a decade earlier, they rented in a ritzy enclave on the northeast side of Indianapolis.

Pence's financial disclosures filed when he was a congressman show that he wasn't paying a mortgage from 2007 onward. In 2008, however, Pence reported receiving rental income of at least $2,500 from a residence in Columbus, Indiana.

It's not clear when exactly they sold their Edinburgh residence.

Pence's vice-presidential financial-disclosure forms — he filed four of them since joining Trump in July 2016 — do not show him owning any property, including a home in Edinburgh.

One Pence aide said the Pences would be splitting their time between Washington and Indiana for the next six months before permanently moving back to Indiana. But the aide declined to say where exactly they would be staying.

A spokeswoman for Holcomb did not respond to questions of whether he had to sign off on any stay by the Pences. Pence presided over $162,000 in renovations to the cabin six years ago, when he was governor.

Big decisions ahead

The Pences have many decisions to make now that they are out of the White House beyond just finding a place to live. They also need to find some work while they decide how and whether to plot a bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

Shortly after the election, the Pences were deciding which aides would stay on with them after he left office. The former vice president has also been eyeing a position at the helm of Christian colleges like Hillsdale College in Michigan or the embattled Liberty University in Virginia.

Taking over as president of Liberty University would give Pence a nice paycheck (the former Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. earned more than $1 million a year). It would also give him a strong political perch with religious evangelicals as the Republican Party dives deeper into a civil war, two Republicans close to the Pences told Insider.

The Pences' housing situation for years had been seen mostly as a bit of Indiana political trivia. But it took on prominence during the pandemic. As Pence and Trump fought to stop states from allowing mail-in voting — which many turned to as a safety measure to protect against the coronavirus — both US leaders cast their ballots by mail.

Trump voted using his private South Florida club as a primary address. Pence voted listing the Indiana governor's mansion as his residence, despite not having lived there in four years. Pence's legal counsel at the time determined that voting under the auspices of the governor's mansion was legal despite the political risk that it looked odd while he and Trump fought mail-in voting.

Safety a concern

Beyond basic financial concerns, Republicans who spoke with Insider also said they wondered whether Pence and his team were closely guarding their new domicile because of the wave of death threats he faced just three weeks ago.

Some members of the Trump-incited mob that stormed the Capitol earlier this month shouted that they wanted to hang Pence, with some rioters coming within about 100 feet of confronting him and his family as they were hurried to a secure location in the Capitol. A pro-Trump lawyer also publicly threatened execution by firing squad for Pence unless the former vice president helped Trump toss out the election results.

As the Pences make a home outside Washington, they will keep their Secret Service protection for another six months.

""That would make sense,"" one Indiana Republican said of safety concerns for the former vice president. ""They wanted to hang him in the Capitol.""

Trump advisors told Insider that Trump's relationship with Pence has been almost nonexistent since Pence chose to side with the Constitution over Trump. And activists on the far right still blame Pence for not helping Trump overturn the election results.

Republicans close to the former vice president told Insider they're not sure whether Pence has a future in the GOP considering large swaths of Republicans still support Trump and believe Democrats stole the 2020 election.

The beneficiary of public housing

Indiana Republicans have joked that Pence has been the beneficiary of public housing for eight years.

Pence earned a salary of almost $112,000 when he served as Indiana governor. He also got four years of free housing at the governor's mansion (his predecessor, Gov. Mitch Daniels, eschewed the free housing during his eight years in office.)

As vice president, Pence earned a salary of $230,700 a year. He also basked in the many accoutrements that come with the office from the US taxpayer-funded residence at the US Naval Observatory to world travel via Air Force Two.

Karen Pence and their oldest daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond, made a cottage industry while Pence was in office out of publishing a series of children's books about their pet bunny through the conservative publishing house Regnery.

The Pences reported earning up to $50,000 on their first book, ""Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President,"" and said they'd donate the proceeds, according to the New York Post.

The Pences did not disclose the advances they earned on each book, according to the former vice president's 2020 financial disclosure.

Throughout the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, Pence incurred $500,000 in legal fees. Political donors paid the lawyers, USA Today reported last year.

Turning to Trump for charity

The Pences have also struggled to build a solid nest egg while paying for their three children's student loans and suffering through financial hardships.

The vetting team that Trump assembled to review Pence four years ago even noted this: The Pences have never struck it rich, and even had some money troubles in the past.

Shortly before Pence's first run for Congress, his best friend from college lost them about a million dollars in a bad investment. About two decades later, they lost about $700,000 when the family oil company, run by Pence's oldest brother, Greg Pence, went bankrupt. And when the Pences returned to Washington to join the Trump administration, they sought financial aid from Trump to pay for living expenses.

Shortly before the 2017 inauguration, Trump's inaugural committee donated $750,000 to the charity fund that operates the vice president's residence. A former Trump campaign advisor said the money was to cover living expenses for Mike and Karen Pence, but a Pence advisor said it went toward new furniture for the residence after the Bidens moved out with their furniture at the end of the Obama administration.

The Pences, after all, needed at least a bed to sleep in."	-15.18
"Vice President Mike Pence could effectively and immediately fire President Trump by convincing a handful of Trump's Cabinet to invoke Article 4 of the 25th Amendment. By the time Trump appealed, he would already be out of office. Congressional Democrats are publicly urging Pence to take this step — in fact, if he does not, the House will impeach Trump for a second time.

There would be something remarkably neat about Pence being acting president for one week. Trump's term ending with an acting president would be a poetic finale for a man who prefers his Cabinet not hindered by Senate confirmation. America would certainly appreciate the flexibility.

Would Pence do it? He is keeping it as an option, in case Trump becomes ""more unstable"" in his last 10 days in office, CNN reports. But he clearly does not want to take this step, and the conventional wisdom is he won't.

Pence should not only do it, he should take inspiration from the slur running rampant across pro-Trump internet forums, that he is already Judas to Trump's Jesus.

Pence obviously knows the story of Judas Iscariot, but for anyone who doesn't, he is the friend and apostle who sold Jesus to his executioners for 30 pieces of silver, then killed himself in remorse. Not exactly an inspiring role model — Dante puts him in the final circle of hell, being eternally chewed apart by Satan.

But Pence should consider this about Judas: Whatever noble and good things you do in your life, you will forever be remembered for your last big act. And this is Pence's moment in history. Gerald Ford isn't remembered for his college football career or stint as House minority leader — he is and always will be the vice president who took over when Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace, then pardoned him.

Mike Pence will be an ignoble footnote, a historical curiosity — or he will be a legend.

Pence does not appear to be a particularly principled man, though he likes to play-act one. The best explanation for his unswerving loyalty to Trump, through scandal after scandal, is that he is hoping to inherit Trump's political mantle. That dream is over. He is both tainted by his association with Trump and despised by the Trump wing of the Republican Party. After Trump publicly excoriated Pence for not attempting to seize the election for him during a joint session of Congress to tally President-elect Joe Biden's win, a mob of Trump supporters marched on and broke into the U.S. Capitol literally calling for Pence's head. And they brought their own scaffold and noose.

Of course, the best thing for the country at this point would be for Trump to resign. He has lost his party, his office, and his aura of political teflon. And he is widely regarded as a danger to American democracy and national security. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Trump ally, said Sunday he would vote to impeach Trump for inciting insurrection. A handful of Republican senators have publicly called for him to step down and probably don't want to have to vote on conviction.

Trump leaving on his own terms would also be the best thing for Trump, as Andrew McCarthy argues at National Review. The House will impeach him, and if the Senate were to convict him — either before he's out of office or, more likely, afterward, when Democrats take control — he will lose the thing he loves in life as much as fame: money. Specifically, his $200,000-a-year-for-life presidential pension, about $1 million in annual travel expenses, Secret Service protection, and other perks. And he probably won't be able to run for office again, should the political winds shift.

But ""Trump would only abandon the presidency if he felt he had no other choice, most likely because staying put would thrust him into legal trouble,"" CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang writes at Politico. ""Or, if he had something to gain that he couldn't turn down, such as a pardon by the vice president. Neither is the case. Besides, there is nothing Trump dislikes more than a loser. A resignation would amount to quitting, and he views quitters as losers.""

In that sense, Pence forcing out Trump may actually be Trump's best viable hope. A win-win-win.

The hard thing about the Judas narrative is that the most despised figure in the New Testament is also a necessary part of the Jesus resurrection story. Without Judas or some other traitor, Jesus isn't crucified, died, buried, and risen again — and there is no Christianity. It is absurd to compare Trump to Jesus of Nazareth, but if you are inclined toward that particular blasphemy, the 25th Amendment would at least allow Trump the possibility of rising from the political ashes of his own profane immolation."	-15.18
"(CNN) The Biden administration's planned task force aimed at reuniting children who were separated from their parents at the border under the Trump-era enforcement policies will include input from first lady Jill Biden, according to three sources familiar with the planning.

Biden is tasking her East Wing with taking an active role in the reunification project. Her interest in the task force could offer something of a stark contrast with former first lady Melania Trump

Trump made her first trip to visit a border facility for children and families in Texas in June 2018 in the midst of the zero-tolerance separation controversy, but did so wearing a jacket emblazoned with the words, ""I really don't care. Do U?"" The jacket spawned a news cycle of its own, drawing attention away from Trump's objective for the visit, and helping create a public perception of a first lady disinterested in the issue. In an interview several months after her border trip, Trump called the separation of families, ""unacceptable"" and ""heartbreaking.""

The current first lady's upcoming involvement in the issue and its targeted task force will lend visibility to the mission of reuniting children with their parents, which remains a crisis for many families. Lawyers are still unable to reach the parents of 611 children who had been split from their families by US border officials between 2017 and 2018, according to the latest court filing. The Justice Department also officially rescinded the policy Tuesday in a memo to federal prosecutors, even though it had already been ended.

""As the first lady remarked on a 'Charla' with young Latinos earlier this week, her chief of staff, Ambassador Julissa Reynoso, will monitor the federal reunification effort given her background as a lawyer,"" Biden spokesman Michael LaRosa told CNN on Wednesday, confirming the East Wing's anticipated involvement. Reynoso has firsthand perspective, having moved to the United States with her family from a rural village in the Dominican Republic when she was a child.

"It's time for coronavirus vaccine developers — and every American — to get serious about coronavirus variants.

As of Thursday, the more transmissible B1.351 COVID-19 variant first found in South Africa has been identified in the U.S., with other highly transmissible and potentially more deadly variants arriving earlier. That Thursday revelation should be ""a wake up call to all of us,"" top coronavirus official Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a Friday briefing, making it clear that ""will continue to see the evolution of mutants"" as the pandemic continues.

Johnson & Johnson announced Friday that its one-shot coronavirus vaccine candidate is 66 percent effective at preventing the contraction of COVID-19, though it's less effective when faced with the B1.351 variant or the P1 first found in Brazil. Moderna's coronavirus vaccine is meanwhile just as effective against the B.1.1.7 variant first found in the U.K., but the company is still working on a booster shot to increase its effectiveness against the B1.351 strain.

Regardless of how effective these vaccines appear to be, Fauci said Friday that it's clear the coronavirus will continue to mutate to ""evade pressure."" He then called on vaccine developers to prepare to ""adjust readily to make versions of a vaccine"" that are ""specifically"" tailored to emerging variants. Dr. Rochelle Walensky echoed Fauci's suggestion, saying at the White House briefing that ""we should be treating every case as it if it's a variant during this pandemic right now.""

"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18
"The SolarWinds hack is in need of a new name, America's top cybersecurity investigators say.

In late 2020, foreign hackers exploited the widely used SolarWinds software to gain access to hundreds of thousands of federal government computers, as well as private companies' networks. But it turns out that around 30 percent of computers previously thought to be hacked via SolarWinds didn't even run the software, Brandon Wales, acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, tells The Wall Street Journal.

The idea that SolarWinds was the only avenue for the suspected Russian attack limited its potential victims to the software's relatively small user base. But hackers linked to the attack also seem to have broken into government and private accounts by guessing passwords and exploiting issues in Microsoft's cloud-based Office software used by millions of people, government investigators said. ""It is absolutely correct that this campaign should not be thought of as the SolarWinds campaign,"" Wales told the Journal.

Cybersecurity company Malwarebytes backed up investigators' findings, saying last week that it faced the same hackers as the SolarWinds attack. But Malwarebytes doesn't even use SolarWinds; rather, the hackers found a loophole in a Microsoft Office 365 account to break in. The revelation made Malwarebytes' CEO Marcin Kleczynski wonder what software is even safe to keep on company computers. ""How do I know that Zoom or Slack isn’t next and what do I do?"" Kleczynski questioned when talking to the Journal.

Around 18,000 government and private computers are thought to have been compromised in the hack, including networks in the Pentagon, State Department, Justice Department, and other top agencies. President Biden brought up the attack in his first call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kathryn Krawczyk"	-15.18
"Johnson & Johnson has unveiled some highly-anticipated data on its single-shot COVID-19 vaccine.

The company on Friday announced its vaccine candidate in a global trial was found to overall be 66 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19, but 85 percent effective at preventing severe disease. In the United States, the company said the level of protection against moderate to severe illness was 72 percent, but in Latin America, it was 66 percent effective. It was also 57 percent effective in South Africa, where most of the COVID-19 cases were from the B.1.351 variant.

Johnson & Johnson's data had been particularly anticipated because, unlike the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that have been approved in the United States, this candidate only requires one shot. The overall 66 percent efficacy rate wasn't as high as with either of those vaccines, which were each found to be about 95 percent effective, but that's still above the 50 percent level the FDA requires.

University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health vaccine expert Jonathan Temte also told The Washington Post the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could still be a ""game changer,"" especially since it can be stored at refrigerator temperature.

""Back in July and August, I was hoping we would see a vaccine that was 60 percent effective — in my mind, that would be great,"" Temte told the Post. ""And now we have had two that have hit the ball out of the park and set expectations spectacularly high, and that's not fair because we don't need a home run all the times we're up to bat.""

Johnson & Johnson also noted that in the the trial, the vaccine provided ""complete protection against COVID-related hospitalization and death."" The company plans to file with the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization within a week, The Associated Press reports, and it says it ""expects to have product available to ship immediately following authorization.""

"""The discovery of highly transmissible coronavirus variants in the United States has public health experts urging Americans to upgrade the simple cloth masks that have become a staple shield during the pandemic,"" The Washington Post reports. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, suggested on Monday's NBC Today that people consider wearing two masks at the same time, explaining, ""If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on, it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective.""

Experts suggest wearing a surgical mask underneath a cloth mask, assuming you don't have access to N95 or KN95 masks, which afford the most protection. Linsey Marr, an engineering professor at Virginia Tech and mask effectiveness researcher, told the Post that if you don't have access to surgical masks, you can create a protective three-layer mask by sandwiching a high-efficiency filter — like one cut from a vacuum bag — between two tightly woven fabric masks.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises Americans to wear a tight-fitting masks with ""two or more layers of washable, breathable fabric,"" and to leave surgical masks and N95 respirators for health care workers. Fauci appeared alongside new CDC Director Rochelle Walensky at a CNN town hall on Wednesday and advised people to follow the CDC guidelines. Walensky said N95s are uncomfortable and might turn people off of wearing masks entirely.

Many other countries have responded to the contagious new variants by mandating that people wear medical-grade masks in public — Europe's solution — or by mass-producing high-quality masks and shipping them directly to residents, as South Korea, Singapore, and other Asian nations have done, the Post reports. Some medical experts — and The Week's Ryan Cooper — say the Biden administration should consider following Asia's lead.

All available evidence ""suggests two masks are likely more effective than a single mask,"" and ""in situations where you are not able to social distance, you may want to double up by wearing a cloth mask over a surgical mask or two cloth masks,"" Jamie Ueda writes at Reviewed. But ""if you already have trouble breathing while wearing one mask, adding another may not be the best option. The CDC notes wearing one mask is better than not wearing any face covering.""

"(CNN) Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday slammed House Republican leaders for not doing more to rebuke GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia over her shocking rhetoric and past statements, saying the focus must be on leadership.

""What I'm concerned about is the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, who is willing to overlook, ignore those statements,"" Pelosi said at her weekly news conference, days after CNN reported Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians -- including Pelosi -- in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress. The statements were part a CNN KFile review of hundreds of posts and comments from Greene's Facebook page.

Greene is also facing criticism for a video of her confronting Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg before she was elected to Congress went viral Wednesday. And last week, other students who survived the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and families of the victims are calling for Greene's resignation, after comments surfaced that showed her agreeing with people who said the 2018 shooting was a ""false flag"" operation, remarks Pelosi called special attention to Thursday. The California Democrat also criticized Greene's placement on the House Committee on Education and Labor.

""Assigning her to the Education Committee when she has mocked the killing of little children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, when she has mocked the killing of teenagers in high school at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school -- what could they be thinking?"" Pelosi asked Thursday. ""Or is thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing? It's absolutely appalling, and I think the focus has to be on the Republican leadership of this House of Representatives for the disregard they have for the death of those children.""

Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California said he plans to offer a privileged resolution for the expulsion of Greene from the House, which would require a two-thirds majority to pass. And Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida said she is exploring the possibility of a resolution that would strip Greene of her committee assignments if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy doesn't remove her.

"Probably the most wrong thing I have ever written was an article speculating about whether a reform movement would take hold in the Republican Party after they badly lost the 2012 election. Just thinking about it makes me cringe.

On first blush, one might think that right now would a much riper time for conservative reformers than eight years ago. After all, Donald Trump lost a clearly winnable election, and now has saddled the entire party with responsibility for an attempt to overthrow the government — and getting five people killed in the process. If ever there was a time for soul-searching among Republicans, now is that time.

But that is so obviously not happening that nobody, not even the most willfully blind American exceptionalists, is speculating about the possibility. Republicans are going to double down on Trump, culture war grievance politics, violent insurrection, and conspiratorial insanity for the indefinite future.

Perhaps the clearest evidence comes in the form of freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), best known as a believer in the lunatic QAnon conspiracy theory. It turns out that before she ran for office, she posted likes and comments on Facebook indicating support for murdering several Democratic politicians, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. She also endorsed yet more conspiracy theories: one that Clinton had cut off the face of a baby, worn it, and drank its blood as part of a Satanic ritual, another that the 2018 California wildfires were started by a space laser, and another that the Parkland mass shooting was a false flag hoax. Video emerged of her chasing down one of the survivors of the attack, David Hogg, on Capitol Hill in 2019, yelling at him that she was carrying a gun and pelting him with crackpot accusations as he walks away.

At least for the moment, this is as deranged as it gets in American conspiracy land. Older stories about Area 51 and lizard people seem like quaintly charming fables by comparison. If I were a member of Congress in either party I would be quite worried she would harm me or my colleagues (and many reportedly are). A gun fanatic who is completely out of her gourd should not be allowed in the Capitol building.

Yet so far Greene has received no sanction whatsoever from the Republican House leadership, save for an apparent talking-to from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Nor has Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), another conspiracy theorist who was recently found to be very friendly with members of the Three Percenters, an extremist anti-government militia, and insists on carrying a pistol with her at all times. Both were involved in whipping up the insurrectionist mob before January 6.

There is a similar story going on with Trump's hold over the GOP. After a brief moment when it seemed like Republican elites might turn on him for almost getting them killed, almost all the Senate GOP has found an excuse to vote to acquit him on the impeachment charge passed in the House. The Republican base is returning to his side as well. And while Greene is probably going to skate on all her unhinged Facebook posts, there is a growing Republican movement to censure Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wy.) and kick her out of the leadership for voting to impeach Trump.

A key reason for this is just how far Republicans have already gone. The level of extremism they've accepted, like believing that Barack Obama is a secret Kenyan Muslim, or that Democrats and shadowy voting machine companies stole the 2020 election, creates a huge incentive to produce and believe still more extreme stances, so the party faithful does not have to reckon with steadily more-uncomfortable truths — that a majority of Americans do not agree with them, that their party dogma is deranged, and it is conservatives who have tried to overturn the 2020 election. The moral-political framework espoused by the conservative movement is basically similar to liberals' — that democracy and the Constitution are good, elections should be decided by the voters, and so on — but their actual agenda, imposing their will on the country by whatever means necessary, amounts to violent authoritarianism. Thus they must camouflage these intentions with crackpot justifications, and ideally come to actually believe them. Unlike the Nazis, who were openly against democracy, the Capitol putschists claimed that they were trying to stop Biden and the Democrats from stealing the election.

This explains the instant consensus on parts of the right that the Capitol putsch was actually an antifa conspiracy. New Yorker writer Luke Mogelson, who has been reporting on conservatives for a long time and accompanied the insurrectionists when they stormed the Capitol, saw this firsthand. One rank-and-file conservative called him afterward, wanting to know what had happened. ""She was upset — she did not believe that 'Trump people' could have done what the media were alleging,"" he writes. He spoke with her and others on speakerphone, relating his alarming experience. But soon the woman had soothed her cognitive dissonance with clumsily forged agitprop. ""Less than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, 'ANTIFA HAS TAKEN RESPONSIBLITLY FOR STORMING CAPITAL HILL.'"" But then on the other hand, a small portion of the Republican base thinks the putsch was actually good.

It would be a mistake to say Republicans are lying about all this. They are more accurately BSing, in the sense meant by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt. Reality is entirely instrumental to the BSer: ""His eye is not on the facts at all … except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose."" Today, not only do conservatives say whatever is most politically convenient regardless of the truth, they themselves no longer understand that is what they are doing. The very best BSer is someone who can gin up a genuine belief in absolutely anything on cue.

There can be little doubt that had the Capitol putsch ended with multiple members of Congress or even Mike Pence being lynched (as very nearly happened), Republican behavior would not be any different than it is now. They would be quiet for a time while the conservative media desperately searched around for some excuse or misdirection, and once they found one, both base voters and the leadership would dose up on the excuse through Tucker Carlson and photoshopped screenshots on Facebook, and decide everything was fine.

Until the conservative movement pays a real and repeated price for accommodating violent lunacy, it is only going to keep going around in a self-perpetuating cycle of madness. (God help us when someone cruises to power calling Rep. Greene a RINO sellout.) Should they win national power before that happens, that will likely be the end of American democracy. The most common precursor to a successful putsch is an unsuccessful one."	-15.18

"House Democrats plan to make their Republican colleagues go on the record about whether Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) should stay in the House as a member in good standing, with seats on the budget and education committees.

Greene is scrubbing her social media history of incendiary posts, but plenty has already been unearthed this week. The latest is a 2018 Facebook post in which Greene suggested, as New York's Jonathan Chait paraphrases, that deadly ""California wildfires were intentionally set by a Jewish space laser."" Greene has also said school mass shootings were faked, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — one of the several prominent Democrats whose killing Greene appears to have endorsed — used Greene's Sandy Hook hoax comments to slam House GOP leaders.

""Assigning her to the education committee, when she has mocked the killing of little children,"" Pelosi said Thursday. ""What could they be thinking — or is thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing?"" Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) said he will introduce a privileged resolution to expel Greene, ensuring it a floor vote as early as next week.

""Expulsion would require two-thirds support in the House, making it highly unlikely that it will succeed,"" Politico says. ""Still, it will force every single lawmaker, including members of GOP leadership, to go on the record when it comes to Greene."" Meanwhile, her fate ""is fueling tensions throughout the House"" three weeks after the Jan. 6 assault, Politico notes. ""Many Democrats say they are still rattled by the potential role of GOP members in that attack, including Greene,"" who ""has been blamed even by some Republicans for helping to incite the insurrection.""

""The enemy is within the House of Representatives,"" Pelosi said Thursday. ""We have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence against other members."" Some House Democrats, The Washington Post reports, ""have bought bulletproof vests and are seeking other protections.""

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) ""has long struggled with how to address Greene, highlighting the current predicament for House GOP leaders, whose party attracts an increasingly virulent anti-establishment, conspiratorial base,"" the Post reports. He had, and blew, his chance last summer, Axios reports, when he and his leadership team ""discussed — but then largely set aside — fears that"" the ""QAnon-supporting"" Greene ""would end up a flaming trainwreck for their party.""

"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell finally relinquished full control of the Senate to Democrats, agreeing this week to an organizing framework for the evenly split chamber. The breakthrough occurred when moderate Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) publicly pledged not to eliminate the Senate's filibuster rule, which requires a supermajority of 60 votes to pass most pieces of legislation. McConnell, however, failed to get filibuster preservation in the organizing agreement, meaning that their more aggressive Democratic colleagues and the party's activist base will continue to lean on Manchin and Sinema to invoke the so-called ""nuclear option,"" to kill the legislative filibuster.

The two moderate holdouts seem to sincerely believe requiring a supermajority to pass almost any law (outside of the arcane, once-a-year budget reconciliation process) helps foster bipartisanship. But they're wrong. Ending the filibuster is actually one of the last, best hopes of returning some minimal bipartisanship to Washington.

That probably sounds counterintuitive or even crazy. By requiring at least a bit of work across the aisle to pass almost any bill, doesn't the filibuster encourage moderation and compromise in what its defenders call ""the world's greatest deliberative body""? No, it doesn't. What the filibuster actually fosters is acrimony and gridlock while empowering extremists who represent their Twitter feeds rather than their constituents.

For most of this century, the out-party's incentives have been quite clear. Making the president and his party look hapless and weak by holding up priority legislation in Congress has been a surefire route back into power. It's a strategy that demoralizes the other side's supporters by convincing them that even if they win power, nothing gets done. This cynical strategy worked for Democrats after George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, and for Republicans under President Obama, and then again for Democrats under Donald Trump. In a closely divided country, even small shifts in turnout and support can lead to a power transfer, first in Congress and then at the presidential level.

If Democrats go nuclear, they won't just get to actually govern the country rather than trying to jam everything they want to do into a single reconciliation bill before kicking back and doing nothing until 2022, as some prominent liberals recommend. They will immediately change the strategic calculus in both parties, especially for moderates. And yes, those moderates still do exist.

One of the ways to conceptualize the ideological space in Congress is the Voteview project at the University of California-Los Angeles. Using roll-call data, researchers have produced an ideological score for every member of Congress going back to the 19th century.

According to this data, American politics hasn't been as polarized as it is today in more than a century. Yet three Democrats (Manchin, Sinema and the doomed Doug Jones of Alabama) were closer to the most liberal Republican Susan Collins (Maine) than to the average member of their own caucus. It's a similar story on the other side of the aisle, where Collins, Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Shelly Moore Capito (W. Va.) were all more similar to the most conservative Democrat, Joe Manchin, than they were to the average GOP senator.

That's not a lot of people, but these senators could, theoretically, be kingmakers in a narrowly split Senate. Yet on the important issues of the Trump era, like the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and the GOP's 2017 tax cuts, almost all of them fell in line behind their party's position. Only Manchin among Democrats, for example, crossed over for Kavanaugh, when it was clear that Republicans had the votes anyway. On tax cuts, Democrats tried and failed to spike the legislation by picking off Republicans. Not only did Democrats not stop passage of the law, they received zero concessions for their trouble.

No one from this group of moderates played a meaningful role shaping policy. They were, instead, mostly spectators, because in the end party leaders wanted them on board, not negotiating with each other. Of course, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was passed in the Senate with simple GOP majorities through the once-a-year reconciliation process, and the absence of the filibuster from the proceedings didn't lead to a flowering of inter-party cooperation. But reconciliation bills have become apocalyptic showdowns precisely because they are the only time majorities can act with fewer than 60 votes. If moderates and members of the minority party knew that these would be the dynamics of every single legislative negotiation over two years, their incentives would be quite different.

This all seems quite dumb when you step back and think about it. What if Senate majorities were simply allowed to pass legislation, which is the way it works in every other legislative body on the planet? While the U.S. two-party system is rare, supermajority requirements are not a feature of other presidential democracies, like Mexico, nor are they found in parliamentary systems like Canada or the United Kingdom.

What if no one in the minority party believed that they could use the filibuster rule to obstruct and humiliate their opponents and instead could only negotiate in good faith with their counterparts to craft legislation? The guess here is that it would open up some space for governing parties to produce bills that have some support from the opposition.

Under the filibuster rule, the minority leader's chief obligation is to keep the caucus voting together to obstruct the majority's agenda. Moderates, who might otherwise be inclined to band together with their counterparts across the aisle, instead see nothing but the possibility of getting back into power in the next election. It's a zero-sum game, so long as obstruction pays. And people like Collins and Murkowski will typically only defy leadership when their votes aren't needed — when the party leader has ""released"" them to take a vote that might play better in their home states.

The really critical way to think about filibuster reform is this: It takes control of the Senate agenda out of the hands of the minority leader. Remember, obstruction works not by producing resentment against single-party rule, but rather by creating the widespread perception that the president's party isn't getting anything done. If you vaporize the utility of obstruction by nuking the filibuster, you simultaneously free moderates from the grip of party leadership and empower them to work together as a small but crucial bipartisan bloc with effective veto power over legislation.

Democrats have the chance to change the national political environment for the better — not just to improve their own odds in the 2022 midterms and to make Joe Biden's re-election more likely by passing popular reforms, but to end the tyranny of the supermajority, empower both party's moderates to work together and to usher this era of ugly paralysis out the door. If they fail to do so, the Senate will continue masquerading as the site of compromise, when in reality it is where good ideas and bipartisan cooperation go to die."	-15.18
"Justin Timberlake ""will never be a movie star."" That was the blistering verdict of Hollywood's top trade publication, Variety, in 2013, when writer Ramin Setoodeh practically begged the singer to give up on acting. ""An artist who can rock the MTV Video Music Awards like Timberlake doesn't need a second mediocre career,"" Setoodeh's reasoning went.

Timberlake didn't take the advice — though now, almost eight years later, Setoodeh has proven to be right. Timberlake is not a movie star, despite working with titans of the industry: David Fincher, Woody Allen, the Coen Brothers, Jonathan Demme, and, with the release of Palmer on Apple TV+ on Friday, an Oscar-winning producer, Fisher Stevens. But Variety had one thing wrong back in 2013, too: Timberlake never intended to become a ""movie star,"" and you can't judge his acting career without first and foremost understanding what he set out to do.

Conveniently, Timberlake all but stated what his intentions were back in 2010. Speaking with Parade in the weeks before the release of The Social Network — the film that, for many cinephiles, would put him on the map as a serious actor to watch thanks to his memorable portrayal of Napster founder Sean Parker — the former-boy-band-singer-turned-successful-solo-artist said he wasn't seeking out fame or money with his pursuits on the big screen. ""I'm ... extremely aware of the perception of me as an artist,"" Timberlake told the magazine 11 years ago, adding: ""That's why I chose the smaller films that I've done. I thought that I'd rather have the experience of the process from people who are really respected and admired, and characters that I can really dive into, rather than cash in, so to speak.""

Timberlake was 29 at the time of the quote; this weekend, he turns 40. It would have been fully understandable if he'd been speaking at the time with a youthful idealism about his art, only for him to pragmatically pursue more lucrative gigs once becoming a husband and father of two. But over the last decade, Timberlake remarkably hasn't wavered from his intentions with acting, and his emphasis on working with people he admires on projects he's passionate about. He is considered and deliberate in his choice of films; Palmer is his first live-action role since 2017's Wonder Wheel, and before that he hadn't acted in a movie since 2013's Inside Llewyn Davis, a pickiness that nearly rivals Daniel Day-Lewis'. Aside from maybe the Trolls soundtrack — which is hardly an unusual partnership for a celebrity musician — you can't accuse Timberlake of selling out anything other than concerts.

Timberlake's resistance to the Hollywood movie star machine is part of what makes him an unconventional actor, and mystifying to critics who don't understand his perceived lack of ambition. Back around the time that Variety was excoriating the actor, other industry experts also expressed concern that without accepting a macho, action hero role in a movie, his only appeal would be with fawning, former *NSYNC fans. As a publicist told Vulture in 2010, Timberlake ""seems like a guy only women respond to, not a guy's guy … I have my doubts that guys will respond to him as a leading man."" Box Office Guru's Gitesh Pandya expressed similar concerns about Timberlake's choice of roles. ""[H]e needs to work on getting the male audience to be a really big star,"" Pandya told The Wall Street Journal. ""Males can't look at him as a teenybopper heartthrob who grew up. He needs to almost be a macho action star if he wants to be another Will Smith."" Beyond the sexist undertones-that-are-barely-undertones of such quotes, the unspoken assumption is that Timberlake should want to be another Will Smith.

But it's been the sensitive, quieter, and emotionally complex characters that have attracted Timberlake. In his first major on-screen role in Alpha Dog in 2006 — a movie best remembered today for the distinction of dropping the eighth most F-bombs in film history — Timberlake played a goofy, sympathetic stoner who tragically gets involved in the murder of a 15-year-old. At the time, On Milwaukee felt the need to caution in its review of Alpha Dog that ""to write off this film because of the fact that Timberlake stars would be horribly wrong."" In truth, he ends up being the wrenching moral heart of the story. Likewise, in his latest film, Palmer, Timberlake plays an ex-convict whose rough edges hide his heart of gold; he ends up taking in a young boy after the child's mother abandons him. Though Timberlake has appeared in a number of genres, from rom-com to crime to sci-fi thriller to sports drama, his commitment to troubled nice-guy characters is unusual for Hollywood. Even Mark Ruffalo, who shares a spot on the shelf of sensitive male actors, still eventually played the Hulk.

Instead, Timberlake puts his time into nourishing his interest in acting as an art, and finding filmmakers who will respect it. That doesn't always end in triumph; his highest-rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes is a concert film, perhaps somewhat of a testament to his risk taking. Still, at a glance, his filmography looks like a passport of stopovers with some of the best directors in the business. What makes Timberlake's ""film tourism"" work — rather than come across as a vanity project — is that he's a good enough actor to actually earn his roles. It's not unusual for him to end up the best part of both mediocre and brilliant movies. ""No one had to audition more or work harder than Justin to get into [The Social Network],"" Aaron Sorkin told The Agency. ""We were putting together a very balanced ensemble cast, and to parachute this international superstar into the middle, we were concerned that it might be a problem."" Timberlake, on his own talent, assured that it wasn't.

Still, he's not been faultless in his journey. There's the fact that Runner Runner exists. And Timberlake's judgement can sometimes be questionable: he controversially chose to work with Woody Allen on Wonder Wheel, paid tribute to his former collaborator Michael Jackson in his concert film Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids, and had to issue a public apology to his wife, Jessica Biel, after he was caught holding hands with his Palmer co-star Alisha Wainwright — not to mention his role in Janet Jackson's infamous 2004 Super Bowl halftime ""wardrobe malfunction."" But Timberlake would be the first to tell you that he's still finding his way. Despite 15 on-and-off years in Hollywood, he characterized Palmer to The New Yorker as his ""first real 'this is your movie' experience.""

If Timberlake wanted to be a movie star, he could have had that experience a long time ago. But he's not interested in milking his reputation as a pop celebrity just to have his name hung in lights on a different kind of venue. Timberlake acts for the love of the art; it's clear in his performances, from his infectious Sean Parker to his man-of-few-words in Palmer. ""I don't necessarily crave to be a movie star,"" Timberlake expanded to MTV in 2010, in yet another quote that let his critics know, firmly, where he stands. ""I just want to be an actor.""

Eleven years on, it's unquestionable to say that he is."	-15.18
"It's hard to imagine Team Biden ever thought the GOP would swallow whole another $2 trillion in spending just a month or so after Congress passed a nearly $1 trillion relief bill. And it's not just the total amount of spending. Even Republicans who think, for example, that state and local governments need more financial assistance — and they do — doubt the need for $350 billion of additional help. Same goes for the $3,000 child tax credit. Just too, too much in such an already big proposal. In reality, the humongous Biden plan seems built for potential compromise. Cut a bit here, trim a bit there, and give Republicans some of their asks.

Now it seems, however, that to get a big chunk of that nearly $2 trillion relief plan passed will mean going around the GOP. Biden and his congressional allies likely will have to employ the budget reconciliation process. That probably means a smaller bill and one that excludes non-fiscal items like raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.

While no doubt frustrating for many Democrats, it's really for the best. For starters, the U.S. economy simply doesn't need a $1.9 trillion tsunami of new spending, at least not to boost economic growth in the short-term by increasing demand. While many Americans may be under the impression that the U.S. has been doing its fiscal response on the cheap, that's not the case. As it stands now, only Japan has spent a greater share of its economy in fighting the virus and its economic impact. Tack on an additional nearly $2 trillion and no other rich country is even close. If the point of the spending is to ""fill the hole"" of lost GDP growth, we've already done the job of filling most of it.

Nor is the Biden plan needed to avoid slipping back into a recession. The risk was almost certainly taken off the table when Congress passed that $900 billion relief bill in late December. The consensus Wall Street forecast is for at least 4 percent GDP growth, inflation-adjusted, this year and 3 percent next. And it's not hard to find forecasters looking for even faster growth, perhaps the best two-year stretch of economic growth since the mid-1980s. (All this assumes not screwing up the vaccine rollout.) This is an economy that looks ready to roll even without an additional $2 trillion of juice, which Wall Street isn't expecting. A relief plan at half the levels Biden is pushing for would be just fine from their perspective, which is the current expectation.

But who cares what Wall Street and its investors think? Well, apparently many Democrats. They keep pointing to the quiescent bond market and low interest rates as evidence that Washington can rack up trillions in additional debt with no downside. And now that Trump is out of office, a rising stock market is seen as proof that Bidenonomics will keep the economy on the mend. But they should consider that investors aren't assuming Full Bidenomics to happen. And that's not just for the stimulus. The big banks are also skeptical that taxes will be raised to the levels proposed during Biden's presidential campaign, nor his other spending proposals funded at levels suggested in his campaign agenda.

We need to keep two things in our head at the same time. First, now isn't the time to freak out about budget deficits and start a push for rapid austerity. Yet deficits and debt are still important policy constraints outside the cartoon world of econ Twitter. While we may not know how much debt is too much, we should not proceed — with federal debt levels already historically high — as if such a limit does not exist for all practical purposes. Policymakers would be wise to assume Econ 101 is still in effect: Over the long run, bigger deficits reduce national saving and thus the funds available for productive private investment. And while interest rates are low, it's also risky to assume they would stay low even in the face of rising inflation from, say, injecting massive fiscal stimulus into an economy already booming.

Nor should Democrats fret about not getting that $15 minimum wage anytime soon. It's not a free lunch, either. An analysis from my AEI colleague Michael Strain notes that in 47 states, at least a quarter of all workers earn less than $15 an hour. It shouldn't be hard to imagine how a sharp boost in the minimum wage might hurt low-wage workers with little experience and few skills. Even high-wage cities can see negative employment impacts from a high minimum wage, such as reduced hours or even job loss, on low-wage workers with less experience.

Accept the good news, America. We're not a failed state. We did a pretty good job, economically at least, fighting the pandemic. The economy is ready to accelerate. We don't need a ton more stimulus. We don't need to cut fat checks to middle-class households that didn't lose a job. Let's get this country jabbed with vaccine and then turn to tackling longer-term challenges."	-15.18
"Novavax, a biotech firm based in Maryland, announced Thursday that its COVID-19 vaccine was 89.3 percent effective at protecting people from the disease in Britain, including against a new and more infectious strain now dominant in the U.K., but only 49 percent effective in a smaller trial in South Africa. More than 90 percent of the South African subjects who got sick were infected with the new strain, according to preliminary results. Novavax announced the interim results of its Phase 3 U.K. study and Phase 2 trial in South Africa in a press release.

Novavax's findings were a sobering signal that the current vaccines won't work as well against the new variants. The company's vaccine appeared to be 95.6 percent effective against the original strain of the coronavirus but 85.6 percent effective against the U.K. variant. Novavax also said its vaccine was 60 percent effective in its South African trial if you excluded the subgroup with HIV. It is already working on a modified version of its vaccine to specifically target the South African variant, which was first confirmed have hit the U.S. on Thursday.

The U.S. has approved COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson is expected to release the findings of its Phase 3 trial sometime next week. Johnson & Johnson has been testing its vaccine in South Africa and Brazil, home to another new mutation, so health experts are hoping to get more clues about how current vaccines fare against the new strains.

Novavax said it has already started the process to seek regulatory approval for its vaccine in the U.K., and it could be approved in the U.S. as early as April, though the Food and Drug Administration might wait for the results of its ongoing Phase 3 trial in Mexico and the U.S. Public health officials would welcome any new supply of a safe and effective vaccine. The FDA has said vaccine candidates have to be at least 50 percent effective. The U.S. contributed $1.6 billion to Novavax's vaccine effort last year and has preordered 100 million doses.

"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18
"In the wake of the recent deadly pro-Trump riot, the head of the U.S. Capitol Police is calling for ""permanent fencing"" at the Capitol.

Yogananda Pittman, acting Capitol Police chief, on Thursday argued ""vast"" security improvements at the Capitol must be implemented, over three weeks after a mob of supporters of former President Donald Trump breached the building.

""In light of recent events, I can unequivocally say that vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure must be made to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, back-up forces in close proximity to the Capitol,"" Pittman said.

The riot at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 left five people dead, and it occurred as Congress was meeting to certify President Biden's election win. The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday issued a terrorism advisory bulletin warning of a ""heightened threat environment across the United States,"" and it expressed concern that extremists may be ""emboldened"" by the attack on the Capitol.

Pittman's statement on Thursday came after she apologized to lawmakers earlier this week for the security ""failings"" surrounding the riot, acknowledging Capitol Police ""should have been more prepared for this attack"" and that ""we knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.""

In response to Pittman's statement calling for permanent fencing, CNN's Abby Phillip on Thursday wrote that ""one of the great things for D.C. residents and millions of visitors is the public space at and around the Capitol,"" and ""it will be a sad day if that goes away."" NBC News' Kasie Hunt also said that ""it is worth considering what we stand to symbolically lose by putting up a permanent fence around the People's House,"" while The Washington Post's Mike DeBonis criticized Pittman's statement, writing, ""Our elected representatives do not have to automatically do what the USCP brass demand be done in order to deflect attention from their own massive failings.""

"Facebook's independent ""Supreme Court"" is out with its first rulings — and at least in this initial batch of cases, it has mostly sided against the company.

The Facebook Oversight Board, which will review appeals of Facebook's moderation decisions, on Thursday revealed its first five rulings, and in all but one case, the group decided to overturn Facebook's decisions, NBC News reports.

First, the board overturned Facebook's removal of a post that ""commented on the supposed lack of reaction to the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China"" because it ""did not reach the level of hate speech."" Next, it overturned the removal of photos that included uncovered nipples because they were allowed for raising breast cancer awareness.

It also overturned the removal of a post featuring an alleged Joseph Goebbels quote, with the board finding the post ""did not support the Nazi party's ideology."" Finally, the removal of a post that ""included claims that a cure for COVID-19 exists"" was overturned, as the board determined Facebook hadn't ""demonstrated the post would rise to the level of imminent harm."" The only one of the five cases in which the board actually upheld's Facebook's decision had to do with a hate speech case, in which the user posted a ""demeaning slur"" about Azerbaijanis.

This first set of decisions, which Facebook says are binding, is particularly significant because the board was recently handed by far its biggest case yet: the suspension of former President Donald Trump. The oversight board will decide in the coming weeks whether Facebook was right to suspend Trump in the wake of the deadly Capitol riot — and after these first rulings were revealed, NBC News' Dylan Byers wrote, ""If I'm Donald Trump, I'm cautiously optimistic about getting my Facebook account back right now.""

"Violent metaphors are standard stuff in U.S. politics, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor Tuesday. That means, he argued, it's unfair to proceed with an impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump for ""inciting violence against the government of the United States"" if all he did was speak as American politicians routinely do.

""Democrats insist on applying a test of incitement to a Republican that they refuse to apply to themselves,"" Paul said. ""I want Democrats to raise their hands if they have ever given a speech that says 'take back,' 'fight for your country' — who hasn't used the word 'fight' figuratively?""

Paul's characterization of Trump's words is far too generous: The ex-president told the soon-to-be-rioters to ""walk down to the Capitol"" and ""show strength"" because ""you'll never take back our country with weakness,"" a directive he issued while scorning some ""hopeless"" lawmakers present in the Capitol at that very moment.

And Paul was undoubtedly posing his question rhetorically — but I think we should discuss it seriously. Maybe we should stop urging people to ""fight"" each other if we don't want to real fights. Maybe we should stop talking up revolutions if we don't actually want one.

This rhetoric has been on my mind from before Paul spoke — since the storming of the Capitol, in fact. I've been thinking about the American predilection for quoting our countries' founders, a habit strongest among (though not limited to) libertarians, conservatives, and various creatures of the far right. When I was in seminary, I had a part-time gig doing social media management for a libertarian activism organization, and I shared a lot of these historic quotes. My reasoning then was that they at least had more substance than the standard social media fare. They weren't inane memes, and that had to count for something. I'd make sure the quotes I posted were authentic and sometimes link to their context in a letter or treatise if I could easily locate it.

I can't remember if I ever posted the specific quotes I've been mulling since that ""walk down to the Capitol"" left five dead and injured dozens more (the Capitol Police Officers' Union reports brain damage, cracked ribs, one officer stabbed with a metal fence post, and another due to lose an eye). I'm thinking of quotes like this line, which Thomas Jefferson originally penned to James Madison in 1787: ""I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."" Or this, from another letter he wrote the same year: ""The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it's [sic] natural manure.""

I have a vague but possibly false memory of deciding to eschew the ""tree of liberty"" quote when worked that social media job. But if I did post these or similarly combative quotes, I did so reading them figuratively. If I shared content suggesting ""a little rebellion"" can be a ""good thing,"" I was thinking of peaceful protest, or organizing people to call elected officials, or primarying a bad incumbent. That sort of thing.

But that's not what Jefferson was thinking. Here's the context immediately preceding the ""tree of liberty"" quote:

We have had 13. states independent 11. years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half for each state. What country before ever existed a century and half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? [Thomas Jefferson, via Monticello, spelling and punctuation all original]

The tree may be figurative; the blood is not. Jefferson really wanted the populace to rise in armed rebellion from time to time, even against a government he helped create. I don't think he would have supported the storming of the Capitol on behalf of Trump's election fraud lie — but only because he would have rejected the reason for the protest. Supply a better cause and I suspect Jefferson would be all for overrunning the legislature. So enthusiastic was he about the occasional insurrection that he argued for keeping consequences minimal so as not to scare future insurrectionists away: ""[H]onest republican governors"" should be ""mild in their punishment of rebellions, as not to discourage them too much,"" he said in the note to Madison. ""It is a medecine [sic] necessary for the sound health of government.""

Jefferson is perhaps the most quotable, but he wasn't unique among the founders in thinking a perceived lack of liberty and good governance could warrant a violent response. (This should come as no surprise; after all, they did a Revolution.) We can find similar sentiments in the words of Abraham Lincoln and other post-Revolutionary figures, too.

That is not where most Americans are today. Some of us might cheer a violent regime change somewhere else in the world (or even want our military to effect it), but the vast majority does not want political violence here. We complain a lot about our Constitution, our politicians, anything and everything in Washington, but violent overthrow? Insurrection? ""What signify a few lives lost""? They signify a lot! You don't have to share my commitment to nonviolence to be unwilling to follow Jefferson here.

But the Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol, deluded though they were about their justifying cause, did follow Jefferson here. They read him correctly — not ethically, in my view, but in terms of his intent.

And they had plenty of opportunity to do so. Violent references from our national past that were not figurative when first spoken are everywhere in American public life. We treat them as mundane, old-timey, the stuff of Colonial Williamsburg and elementary school history lessons. On Independence Day, we set off fireworks to celebrate killing people so we could have our preferred system of governance. New Hampshire's state motto is ""Live free or die."" District of Columbia license plates use a revolutionary slogan to issue a perpetual (and perpetually empty) threat.

Research suggests metaphors about ""fighting"" are enough to make some people more supportive of political violence. So what happens when they hear sincere praise of insurrection from the most revered saints of American civil religion? Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised if some subset of the public takes it as literally as it was originally intended.

As for me, I hope my memory of a private moratorium on the ""tree of liberty"" is correct. I'll certainly never interpret it figuratively again, nor will I share it assuming others will read into it a peaceful intent. Jefferson's defense of liberty included spilling blood. Mine cannot."	-15.18
"Colloquially, about the only thing worse than going to the Department of Motor Vehicles is getting a root canal. Even that, though, may be up for debate: ""At the end of the day, a root canal procedure is shorter, and in some cases, less painful,"" the auto site MotorBiscuit.com quips.

But DMVs and root canals have nothing on the excruciating process of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccine — much less figuring out when you're eligible — in the United States. Conflicting information, dose shortages, and overloaded scheduling websites are holding up what is arguably the most crucial stage yet in our fight against the pandemic. Every delay, mishap, and hiccup means more people will die. But while the DMV long ago became shorthand for bureaucratic red tape, long waits, and government inefficiency, the lessons America can learn about vaccine distribution from the department might, ironically, be our best chance at saving lives.

At the current rate of vaccination, it will take ""six, seven, eight years for this country to get vaccinated,"" Starbucks' CEO Kevin Johnson warned NBC News in an eye-grabbing headline last week. So far, Pfizer and Moderna have delivered a mere 44 million vaccines, while only about 6 percent of the country has received a first dose. Supply issues mean there have been thousands of appointments canceled and postponed from coast to coast. But those people are the lucky ones; at least they briefly had an appointment at all. Questions of eligibility, shifting priority lists, and a lack of clarity over how to schedule an appointment bog down people who are desperate for vaccines — particularly the elderly.

""There were literally 85-year-old, 90-year-old people standing there in tears, with printed appointment confirmations, saying: 'I don't understand why I can't get vaccinated. I'm 85,'"" one witness at an especially egregious vaccination site in Philadelphia told WHYY.

Getting a pair of shots into the 200-million-plus arms required to establish herd immunity in the United States was never going to be an easy job, but it didn't have to be this hard. Israel, the global standard-bearer, predicted earlier this month that by March or April, it will have vaccinated everyone who is eligible and willing in the nation of 9 million. Israel's speed doesn't just come from it being a small country; its ""socialist-minded"" health-care infrastructure, which is already in place and extends coverage to all citizens, is a huge reason for the nation's swift success. The Atlantic recounted one Israeli citizen's experience with getting a vaccine through his health-maintenance organization, or HMO:

He logged into his account on his HMO site when he learned it was his turn, chose a vaccination center based on his location, and scheduled an appointment. ""Thirty seconds after confirming, I got a text on my cell with all the info, including date, time, place, and already a second appointment for [the] next shot, exactly three weeks apart,"" he told me. It all took ""less than two minutes."" [The Atlantic]

Sounds positively blissful. But of course, the United States has nothing close to Israel's universal health-care system — which is bad news when ""nations faring well against the virus"" are the ones that are ""drawing on pre-existing strengths, not flexing muscles suddenly conjured amid the crisis or, say, a change in administrations,"" The Atlantic continues.

But one existing infrastructure system we do have comes in the form of the Department of Motor Vehicles. In 2018, more than 227.5 million people held valid driver's licenses in the United States — that being roughly the same number of people who need to get vaccinated now to achieve herd immunity. ""[T]he DMV database lists virtually every man, woman, and teenager of each state more accurately than the state's own census or tax roles,"" Wired noted in a 1994 piece on the mind-boggling reach of the agency, adding that ""even people who don't drive usually end up getting 'identification' cards, issued by the state DMVs, so they can do simple things like write a check or buy an alcoholic drink.""

If you need to organize Americans, the DMV is the place to start.

Most Americans, though, thoroughly despise the department, complaining about everything from its long wait times to its disgruntled employees to the hoop-jumping required for something as simple as renewing a driver's license. Right-wing critics will often cite the department as their ""gotcha"" that socialism doesn't work. Certainly the DMV has its problems — but that's mostly because it's one of the country's social services that conservatives have gutted to the point of inefficiency. States facing budget crises, for example, will often shutter dozens of DMV locations, exacerbating long wait times at remaining locations and making work harder for the ""rude,"" understaffed employees who have to deal with clients who walk in already irritated. And even though the DMV has a bad reputation, it's far more straightforward than trying to get something sorted out with a massive corporation; as my colleague Ryan Cooper succinctly put it: ""Going to the DMV is often a pain, but I'd much rather get my license renewed than try to get Verizon to fix a piece of broken equipment.""

Most importantly, the DMV gets the job done. People who want a driver's license can usually get one, paying no more for it than the requisite fee plus potentially a few cranky hours of their time. Though it's the demonized epitome of government bureaucracy, the ""take-a-number"" approach of the DMV is what is missing from our disastrous rollout of the vaccine so far. Imagine, for example, if there were a department that was able to quickly sort Americans by priority and age, and subsequently assign everyone a number in line, and an estimated wait time for their shot? It would not only alleviate a lot of stress and anxiety, it would prevent line-cutting (the DMV is nothing if not a humbling equalizer!) and give a clear, logical structure to the vaccination process. Not only that, but the majority of Americans already have experience with the department; though there would be the expected grumbling about navigating a similar government system, it sure beats frantically calling your local Publix.

Yes, there is often a lot of waiting at the DMV. But at this rate, the vaccine rollout is going to look like a geological epoch by comparison. In addition to expediting the production of doses, we desperately need a distribution system that is both familiar to most Americans, as well as simple, consistent, and painless.

Or at the very least, easier than a root canal."	-15.18
"Hey! Listen! Make The Legend of Zelda into a TV series!

I'm surprised I have to insist at all. We're living in the golden age of both the gritty reboot and the high-budget sci-fi/fantasy series; The Legend of Zelda should've been a no-brainer, snapped up by the likes of HBO or Netflix years ago. Instead, the classic Nintendo video game remains bafflingly undeveloped as content-hungry streamers otherwise greenlight every script that so much as mentions fairies or swords. Forget a live-action Harry Potter series though: It is Zelda that could be the next great show on TV.

The main quest of every streaming service since at least 2013 has been to find ""the next Game of Thrones."" HBO is doing this … by making more Game of Thrones. Amazon is dumping money into a Lord of the Rings live-action multi-season series. Netflix is busy planning at least two spin-offs of its hugely-popular Witcher franchise. Disney is doing what Disney does best, and flooding the market with Star Wars projects. Even Apple TV+, otherwise the runt of the streaming litter, has a high-budget sci-fi project cooking. This week, The Hollywood Reporter claimed that the further creation of a Harry Potter TV series by HBO Max-owner WarnerMedia is a ""top priority.""

But despite all evidence indicating we're in the midst of a genre television bonanza, streamers have overlooked The Legend of Zelda. First released in 1986, the franchise turns 35 this year, and includes some 19 games in the main series, the most recent being Breath of the Wild from 2017. Critics consider several of the installments — though especially 1998's The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time — among the greatest video games ever made.

Hesitation over tackling Zelda might come from the perception of a ""video game curse,"" the idea that games will never be as enjoyable when they're made into movies and TV due to the inherently derivative nature of gameplay. This concern was raised by The Atlantic during one cycle of Zelda TV rumors back in 2015: ""[T]he real magic comes from the player's agency and ability to explore the world,"" the author, David Sims, wrote. ""There's no need to get too bogged down in story detail and nuance since there's so much else to do."" But Zelda is different. From its richly-imagined Medieval kingdom of Hyrule to its charismatic, elfin protagonist Link, to the franchise's subversive flip on classic fantasy tropes — like that the ""damsel in distress"" of the title, Zelda, is a nimble fighter who sometimes uses the male identity Sheik — Zelda has always been an especially narrative- and character-driven franchise. With a big enough budget, keen casting, attention to the music, and a good storyteller at the helm, it would be a surefire hit.

Zelda's owner, Nintendo, though, has historically been protective of its properties after embarrassments like the widely-reviled 1993 Super Mario Brothers film. But as other cinematic universes like the MCU and MonsterVerse have found success in recent years, the Japanese company's reluctance seems to be slipping. In 2019, Nintendo allowed for the live-action Detective Pikachu; as of September 2020, a new animated Super Mario Bros. movie is still on track for a 2022 release. There have even been several rumors of a potential Zelda TV series over the years: one from 2015, though Nintendo's then-CEO debunked the report, as well as another in 2018, when Castlevania producer Adi Shankar teased on Instagram that he was ""working with an iconic Japanese gaming company to adapt one of their iconic video game series into a series."" Despite excited reporting that the project was surely Zelda, Shankar was actually alluding to Devil May Cry, a stylish, demon-hunting action franchise.

At this point, the biggest hurdle for a Legend of Zelda TV series seems to be Nintendo's dogged insistence that its franchises remain family friendly. But approaching a Zelda project as a kid-friendly Game of Thrones misses the mark. Besides — Nintendo basically tried that already. In 1989, a goofy animated Legend of Zelda TV show ran for one disastrous season; today it is best remembered as an internet meme. But Zelda's original fans are all adults now, and any reboot should be treated with the same maturity afforded to its competitors like The Witcher, Game of Thrones, and the eventual Lord of the Rings series. What's more, with its screeching, zombie-like ReDead monsters, its oddly unsettling themes, and the inclusion of the creepypasta-spawning Majora's Mask in the Zelda canon, insisting on a show being kid-friendly seems to be in direct opposition to the franchise's darker mythos.

Dedicated fans of The Legend of Zelda might still balk at a television adaptation. For those like myself —for whom Link's Awakening, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and The Wind Waker were sacred parts of childhood — it's painful to think of the franchise tarnished by bad CGI, weak writing, or even giving Link a voice. ""I'm scared [that] such a deal with Netflix or any other studio at the minute may dilute what we love about the series and take away the magic that draws us in with such incredible design, time, and care put into creating the games,"" wrote the author of a 2015 Change.org position aimed at ensuring no TV plans went forward.

The high level of competition for fantasy epics on television these days, though, raises the bar for an eventual Legend of Zelda adaptation. The possibilities are endless. Any studio searching for the next Game of Thrones ought to get the message — and take this."	-15.18
"Here are some things we know to be true a year into this pandemic:

One, remote learning is awful for most students, and outcomes are worst for the youngest students and those already disadvantaged. (""An estimated three million children nationwide — many impoverished or homeless — are going without any form of school,"" New York magazine reports.)

Two, children are a very low-risk demographic for serious cases of COVID-19, and repeated studies have shown they are not a significant vector of viral transmission. Kids are more likely to receive COVID-19 from an adult than vice versa.

And three, open schools are not doomed to be super-spreader locations. Economist Emily Oster made a data-based case for schools' remarkable safety (with reasonable precautions, of course) in The Atlantic in October. In the months since, though some school-centered outbreaks have been documented, her thesis has held, including in high-risk communities. More than nine in 10 private schools maintained some or all face-to-face learning, and they've generally proved capable of operating safely, even when enrollment grows as families with the resources to do so flee public distance learning. Some public school districts are successfully educating in person, too.

For the more cautious districts and those in areas with the worst outbreaks, the endgame is vaccinating teachers and staff, the adults in school settings who are at risk of catching or transmitting serious bouts of COVID-19. Once the teachers are vaccinated, schools can reopen.

Or rather, that's what's supposed to happen. But in Fairfax County, Virginia, the teacher's union has other ideas — ideas that will do real damage if they spread.

About 90 percent of the district's staff have received or are on the list to receive their vaccines, meaning a vaccination-conditioned reopening is a near-term possibility. But the Fairfax Education Association is opposed to fulltime, in-person classes this spring even if all its teachers have had their shots. The union also wants every student vaccinated plus 14 days of zero community spread.

That latter condition likely guarantees no normal education in 2021. Even after vaccination is widespread, we may see some limited community transmission of COVID-19 for a long time to come, maybe forever. Predictions that outbreaks could run like an annual flu season are plausible, and a place like Fairfax County — just outside Washington, D.C., with three international airports in the region — is probably very far from zero community transmission.

The first condition may be even more ridiculous, however. Though testing is underway, there is currently no COVID-19 vaccine approved for children under 16. The union has asked for something it literally cannot have. (Reason's Robby Soave, thinking perhaps union boss Kimberly Adams had been misquoted, reached out to her for confirmation that complete student vaccination was really what she'd stipulated. It was. Soave followed up to note the present impossibility of that goal. She did not reply.)

Adams and the Fairfax Education Association used to accept teacher vaccination as the benchmark for resuming face-to-face instruction fulltime: ""[N]o one should return to in person instruction until there is a widely available scientifically proven vaccine,"" the union said in a letter this past fall. Its new stance puts the group at odds with a statewide teachers union, which has made teacher vaccination its goalpost. Teachers in other states are likewise hailing vaccination, for which educators are a priority demographic in many places, as the beginning of the end. In the Twin Cities, where I live, the debate is about whether waiting for all teachers to be vaccinated is necessary to get back in the classroom (local transmission has been declining here since mid-November).

That — not this nonsense in Fairfax County — is where the debate should be. In August, I was uncertain about school closures. Now, I think there's ample evidence schools can and indeed should open safely even before all teachers are vaccinated, though I understand why not everyone is equally convinced. But to layer on additional requirements after teachers are protected is untenable, and it makes giving them vaccination priority over people working in public spaces incredibly unfair. It takes teachers unions' pro-closure record past any point of defensibility, and it needs to be squashed dead in Fairfax.

""One might argue,"" Oster wrote in October, ""that any risk is too great, and that schools must be completely safe before local governments move to reopen them. But this approach ignores the enormous costs to children"" — to say nothing of their beleaguered parents — ""from closed schools.""

The next few months matter. The four-month stretch from February to May is fully 5 percent of a second-grader's life! For adult teachers, those months will slip by quickly enough, but for their students struggling with a third semester of Zoom instruction, that time will feel interminable and could easily be life-altering. Waiting until September or maybe even later — as will happen if the Fairfax County union gets its way or its demands are replicated elsewhere — will make a real difference to the final sum of the pandemic's costs. Vaccinated teachers must mean open schools."	-15.18
"Sarah Huckabee Sanders' candidacy for governor of Arkansas is one of the funniest things I've heard this year.

Funny, because, well of course. Sanders' political ambitions have been obvious ever since she departed as former President Donald Trump's press secretary, telling The New York Times in a 2019 interview that she felt ""called"" to serve as senator or governor. Funny, because her announcement — less than four weeks after the outgoing president incited a riot intended to keep him in power — could not be more ill-timed. And downright hilarious, if Sanders believes voters of Arkansas don't deserve better from their leader than a stooge for Trump.

For almost two years — or about 64 Mooches — between 2017 and 2019, Sanders served as Trump's battering ram, his wall, and his liar-in-chief. In her jewel-tone dresses and softly-curled television hair (courtesy of her office's government-funded stylist), the daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee quickly earned a reputation for wielding the podium of the White House press secretary like a verbally abusive P.E. teacher.

Sanders' predecessors, Sean Spicer and Anthony Scaramucci, weren't exactly agreeable. But Sanders — who was reportedly given the gig because ""there wasn't anybody else"" — brought a Trumpian combativeness to the briefings. She was known for her blunt answers (""frankly I don't think ['animals'] was strong enough,"" she told the press when asked about Trump's use of the dehumanizing word to describe ""some immigrants""), her defenses of the indefensible (calling it ""very Biblical"" to separate migrant families at the border), as well for the sarcasm and insults she'd unload on reporters trying to do their jobs. More recently, she came under fire for mocking President Biden's stutter.

In the video she dropped Monday announcing her campaign, Sanders spent seven long minutes telling Arkansas voters she remains a Trump lackey. She closely aligns herself with the now-disgraced president and spins her old job as akin to the troops they visit in her opening anecdote — a MAGA warrior, essentially. The message might be politically-expedient in a state like Arkansas, where there was a massive 28-point margin in favor of the incumbent president in the election he ultimately lost to Biden, but the timing is still unsavory, coming just weeks after a failed insurrection left five people dead. In fact, Sanders spends more time in her announcement video talking about Trump than her father, though he was governor of the Natural State for 10 years, and remains popular there.

Voters — including voters who backed Trump — deserve better than a leader who's wrapped up in obsequiousness to her former, twice-impeached boss. ""Your governor is your last line of defense,"" Sanders says in her announcement. ""In fact, your governor must be on the frontline."" She's right, but would Arkansans have been able to count on her to defend their lawfully-cast votes the way governors like Georgia's Brian Kemp (R) and Arizona's Doug Ducey (R) were forced to when they stood up to Trump? After energetically defending one of the most dishonest politicians in American history, she has zero credibility when she touts herself as a leader ""with the courage to do what's right, not what's politically correct or convenient.""

And then there are her lies. Though Sanders has defended her reputation, claiming she never said anything that she didn't believe to be true at the time, the evidence overwhelms her and doesn't check out. All White House press secretaries are admittedly in the spin business, their job being to make the president look better. But put in the impossible position of providing backing for Trump's fire hydrant of falsehoods, Sanders offered the American public neither honesty nor transparency. ""Sanders had a front row seat to what Trump was doing and she did nothing to stop him,"" Kurt Bardella, a former House Oversight Committee spokesperson, wrote for NBC when Sanders left her post in 2019. ""She allowed herself to become an instrument of propaganda and an amplifier of extremism. That is her legacy. She could have walked away anytime. But she didn't."" CNN's media correspondent Brian Stelter separately described Sanders' legacy as ""the death of the daily press briefing,"" since she shortened on-camera briefings to the point that they might as well not have been called at all. ""[D]uring Spicer's six months on the job, he and his team totaled more time in briefings and gaggles than Sanders held in the year after he left,"" The Washington Post wrote after Sanders' first year; finally, she did away with on-camera briefings all together.

You wouldn't know it from Sanders' announcement, though, that she pathologically avoided the people whose entire job it was for her to inform. ""I took on the media, the radical left, and their cancel culture,"" Sanders brags in the video. ""And I won."" It's another boldfaced lie; as CNN's Jim Acosta pointed out on Twitter, Sanders attempted to get him banned from the White House using a doctored video, only to lose in court under a Trump-appointed judge. Sanders' ""campaign is going to be gaslit,"" Acosta predicted. The spin has already begun.

The classic Sanders response to this criticism would be, ""with all due respect, you actually don't know much about me."" But with all due respect, her legacy of lies and political opportunism ensure that Arkansas voters actually do."	-15.18
"Josh Hawley knows better than to amplify Donald Trump's lies about losing the election. But the Republican senator from Missouri did so anyway, betting that it would raise his profile among Trump-loving conservative Republicans.

His cynical bet was right on the money.

Hawley has come under fierce criticism in recent weeks for being first out of the gate to oppose the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory — an act that may not have incited the Capitol insurrection, but certainly didn't discourage it. (His fist-pumping salute to protesters on Jan. 6 didn't help things either.) Hawley's political mentor has disowned him, newspapers in his state have called for his resignation, he lost a book contract, and old friends are giving interviews about their disappointment.

For that, Hawley gets the cover of today's New York Post, explaining why he is the real victim of recent events — that he is being ""muzzled"" for having controversial views.

It's time to stand up against the muzzling of America https://t.co/rrTrtfrYZn via @nypost — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) January 25, 2021

""I for one am not going to back down,"" he wrote in an ""exclusive"" column. ""My book will be published, and I will continue to represent the people of my state without fear or favor, whatever the left or the corporations say.""

Needless to say, a politician isn't being muzzled if he gets to command the front page of a Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper. (Another publisher quickly snapped up the rights to his forthcoming book.) Hawley's profile is higher than it has ever been. But if we have learned anything in the few short weeks during which he has commanded the national spotlight, it's that reality — truth — doesn't always guide his actions.

This is all very confusing to Hawley's former friends and colleagues, apparently.

""I absolutely could not have predicted that the bright, idealistic, clear-thinking young student that I knew would follow this path,"" said David Kennedy, a Stanford historian who served as Hawley's adviser. ""What Hawley and company were doing was kind of the gentlemanly version of the pointless disruption that happened when the mob invaded the Capitol.""

""I just think with his moral upbringing, why would he propagate that lie is beyond me,"" added Barbara Weibling, his middle school principal.

""Josh knows better,"" said Thomas A. Lambert, who served with Hawley on the law school faculty at the University of Missouri.

So it is well-established that Hawley knows what he is doing is wrong. But who cares?

For much of the last four years, establishment Republicans tried to have it both ways — supporting Donald Trump, and getting his support in return, while oftentimes offering off-the-record reassurances to reporters that they knew Trump was bad news, and they couldn't wait to be rid of him. There was a sense that the grown-ups were biding their time, even if the time never seemed to come. They knew better. They didn't do better. And now neither is Hawley.

For a few days after the Capitol insurrection it appeared establishment Republicans were ready to throw off Trump's shackles, if only in the interest of literal self-preservation. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) proclaimed ""enough is enough."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) acknowledged Trump's responsibility. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) even apologized to his Black constituents for undermining Black votes by supporting Trump's fraud claims.

That time has already passed. Now, Graham is helping strategize Trump's impeachment defense. McCarthy is trying to blame literally everybody in the United States for the insurrection. Arizona Republicans spent the weekend censuring high-profile members for insufficient loyalty to Trump. There are some exceptions, but the bulk of the GOP seems decided that it is down with Trumpism for the long haul.

Which means that Hawley probably made the right bet for his political future. One poll shows that his favorability among Republicans nationwide actually rose after the Capitol riots. This doesn't mean he will be the party's nominee in 2024 — Trump will probably have something to say about that, one way or another. But it does mean that for all the angry criticism he has taken, Hawley might be in better political shape today than he was at the beginning of the month. Other up-and-comers in the GOP will take note: You can't go wrong with dishonest, cynical pandering to the party's base."	-15.18
"I'm starting to worry the Biden administration isn't taking the fight against COVID-19 seriously enough.

That sounds crazy, I know. Biden was only inaugurated on Wednesday; he can hardly be expected to have accomplished much. And his announced plan is full of excellent and long-overdue initiatives: mask mandates on transportation, expanded testing, and community vaccination centers, including — my particular favorite — mobile units to bring the vaccine directly to people disconnected or remote from health-care providers.

Nonetheless, I worry.

My worries start with the extremely low target for total shots to be administered. A hundred million shots in 100 days may sound like a lot, but that's only one million shots per day. At that rate, it would take nearly two years to inoculate the entire country (assuming two shots per person). The 100 million shot goal doesn't even slightly stretch the existing capacity of vaccine supplies, and more vaccine should be on the way by the spring, both from Pfizer and Moderna and from Johnson & Johnson, assuming their vaccine is approved. Most absurd, this target is barely more than our current run-rate of just over 900,000 shots per day. How could anyone describe that as a ""bold goal?""

Perhaps, as many have suggested, Biden's team is merely setting the bar low so they can vault over it. But low expectations have a funny way of leading to worse outcomes. Politicians, like everyone else, respond to incentives, and if the incentive is to clearly beat the number, then 110 million shots is just as good as 150 million. With a blizzard of other priorities competing for attention, I want the Biden team terrified of taking their eye off the most important ball of all.

And that ball is COVID. It's not just that over 4,000 Americans are dying of it every day. It's not just that the economy can't truly recover until not only the various restrictions Americans have been living under are lifted, but the prospect of such restrictions, which inhibit business investment even when they aren't in place, are clearly behind us as well. It's that neither the American people nor the virus that is ravaging them are going to give Biden and his team the time they seem to think they need.

Let's start with the people. Even last spring, Americans never accepted a level of restriction that many European countries imposed to contain the virus. Since then, the population has grown even more resistant, with millions balking at simple requirements like masking in indoor spaces. The only way even local and limited restrictions — which will be periodically necessary over the coming months to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed — will be obeyed is if they're plainly and clearly time-limited. But only an aggressive vaccine-delivery timeline can provide confidence that such time limits will be real.

The larger worry, though, is the virus itself. The longer the virus circulates widely, the more opportunity it has to mutate into new forms that are deadlier or more transmissible, as it has already done in Britain and South Africa. Compare the CDC-predicted trajectories for the virus with or without the vaccine. Because of the new, more transmissible (and possibly deadlier) British variant, which is already present in America, the pandemic would already be poised for a new lease on life were it not for the vaccines. But at a one million shot/day rate, we may only cut the prevalence of the virus in half by May. That's totally inadequate. Precisely because the new mutations are more transmissible, our goal should be to inoculate as fast as possible, so that the only bottleneck is how much vaccine we can produce — which, in turn, will create the necessary political pressure to ramp up production (and approvals) even faster.

Meanwhile, even the limited progress projected by the CDC assumes that the existing vaccines work equally well against new mutations — which is not certain. For that reason, fighting these new variants doesn't just require travel restrictions and proper surveillance; it requires an even more robust vaccine-deployment infrastructure that can produce new shots optimized against these mutations (something these new mRNA vaccines are particularly suited for). The faster we stand that infrastructure up, the better prepared we’ll be to pivot quickly in response to whatever the virus throws at us.

America has fought a lot of metaphorical wars over the years — against poverty, against drugs — and the thing about these metaphorical wars is that they can never really be won. Not coincidentally, over the same period the real wars we've fought have had the same character: They might be fought to a stalemate, but not to victory. I worry that COVID has already become another such metaphorical war — but it shouldn't be. COVID fatigue and viral mutation are real reasons why the next phase of the battle is going to be hard. They cannot become excuses for failure — nor for failing to achieve victory as quickly as possible. Because victory is absolutely within reach. We just may have to stretch to grasp it.

So that's what I want to see the Biden administration doing: stretching to grasp victory. They shouldn't be setting a low-ball target of 100 million shots in 100 days. They should be setting a target date for universal vaccination — June sounds good to me — and take whatever steps are necessary to hit or beat it. They shouldn't be talking in terms of run rate, but in terms of doubling time — how quickly can we go from one million shots per day to two million, and then to four million. They shouldn't be preparing us to live this half-life for another year. They should be preparing for Broadway theaters and baseball stadiums to be full in the fall, encouraging businesses to plan accordingly, and telling us what they are doing — and what we need to do — to get there.

The last president did a lot of promising and very little delivering, so I can understand why the new administration might want to lower expectations. But Biden didn't win the presidency because Americans got tired of winning. He won because we got tired of waiting."	-15.18
"Angie Thomas is the author of The Hate U Give, a young-adult best-seller since its 2017 release. Below, she names six books that were touchstones as she wrote Concrete Rose, a prequel featuring Starr Carter's father when he was only 17.

The Rose That Grew From Concrete by Tupac Shakur (1999).

This is a collection of poetry written by Tupac before he became a star. The autobiographical title poem, which inspired my novel's title, movingly describes the beauty and resilience that can be found in so many young Black men; beauty and resilience that are often overlooked.

The Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to Alex Haley (1965).

Malcolm X's biography shares his beginnings as a hustler known as Detroit Red and his rise as a civil rights leader who despite his early death continues to influence movements for social justice.

Monster by Walter Dean Myers (1999).

I am able to write the young adult novels that I write only because of Walter Dean Myers. Monster is a modern classic. Through a combination of screenplay excerpts and diary entries, it tells the story of 16-year-old Steve Harmon as he awaits trial for murder, and shows us the dehumanization that Black boys often endure, especially within the justice system.

Long Way Down by Jason Reynolds (2017).

Long Way Down is a masterpiece from one of the best authors that children's literature has ever seen. Told in verse, it follows a young boy, Will, as he takes an elevator ride on his way to avenge his brother's murder. But over the course of the ride, he encounters the spirits of those he's lost to gun violence. Haunting but necessary.

Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates (2015).

Although Coates wrote this book as a letter to his Black son, it is also a letter to all Black boys, and to all of us, about what it truly means to be Black in America.

Dear Justyce by Nic Stone (2020).

Anyone who follows me on social media knows that Nic Stone is one of my best friends, but she's also one of my favorite authors. Her phenomenal follow-up to 2017's Dear Martin tells the story of Quan, a young man incarcerated and accused of murder. More than that, it's a story of Black boyhood, the ways in which the system fails boys like Quan, and how we can create a better world for them.

"It's late, you just got home, and you're hungry. Your front door feels really, really far away. You have some stale bread, some eggs, and some dairy. Or: It's Sunday morning, and your kids are shrieking, and you want to cook something — something quick! — that will get them all starry-eyed and quiet and happy. Or: You're tired of salads and roasted vegetables and even meat and fish and you want something soothing, something easy, and something decidedly un-seasonal for dinner.

In all these cases, and many more: Make French toast. Don't believe me? Go into the kitchen and check — you probably already have everything you need.

Now, let's get cooking.

1. The soak

Get out a rimmed plate or shallow bowl or even a pie pan — my favorite soaking vessel for the bread — and combine your dairy and eggs. I like to use 3 egg yolks for every 1 1/2 cups dairy. (Note: You can mix and match egg yolks and whole eggs, but egg yolks add custardy richness without any eggy flavor.) When it comes to the dairy, you can use milk, half and half, heavy cream, or even a custom combination (look at you!).

Some people add sweetener here, others don't (after all, maple syrup is coming). If you're Team Sweet, whisk in about 1 tablespoon of sugar, agave, honey, whatever, and any flavorings you'd like. Vanilla extract (or better, scraped vanilla bean) is always a great call, but also try almond extract, bourbon, rum ...

(Courtesy Food52)

2. The bread

Start with day-old or even sort of stale bread, which can soak up all that good stuff without falling apart. (No overly soggy French toast here.) Slice it very thickly. I'm a fan of buttery brioche or fluffy challah, but sourdough and whole-wheat are great, too. Let the bread soak in the mixture for 15 seconds on each side (so, 30 seconds in total). Once it's out of its bath, let the bread hang out on a baking sheet for two minutes or so, which encourages even custard-soakage within.

(Courtesy Food52)

3. The toasting

Melt some butter in a pan (bonus points for salted butter and a cast-iron pan). Once it's nice and hot and runny ...

(Courtesy Food52)

Get those soaked bread slices in there! Pan-fry until deeply golden brown on one side, and then flip. (A fish spatula works wonders here.) Get that other side just as brown, and, if you're me, drizzle some maple syrup on, right there in the pan. The warmth will get it evenly distributed — and slightly caramelized, which I love.

4. The finish

Transfer the toast to a plate, drizzle with more syrup, and eat. Quickly, before it gets cold.

French toast is a meal all on its own, but it would never turn away company. Here are some of our favorites to serve with:

Eggs. Scrambled are always a good call, but there's some extra-special about a runny yolk to help ""dress"" the French toast. Take a cue from Canal House and try pimentón-fried eggs, or do as Julia Turshen does and cook them in olive oil.

"President Biden's team has reviewed their predecessors' agenda for COVID-19 vaccine distribution and reportedly discovered the plans had the significant problem of failing to exist. ""There is nothing for us to rework,"" an unnamed source with knowledge of the new administration's COVID-19 efforts told CNN. ""We are going to have to build everything from scratch.""

In that it means months of potential progress have been needlessly lost — that the abysmally slow vaccination pace we've seen since mid-December was not inevitable — this is a horrifying revelation. But there may be an advantage here: The Biden administration can craft its vaccine distribution plan and, crucially, its messaging with a free hand.

The message the Biden administration should be preaching is this: The vaccines are good. In fact, they are remarkably good. They are best-case scenario good. Our goal now is to get these good vaccines into as many people as possible as rapidly as possible so we can return to normal as soon as possible, because that is what the vaccines will enable us to do. Do you hate masks? Are you tired of social distancing? Do you want this whole stupid, awful thing to be over? That is what the vaccines can do — if we get them into our bodies, for, as epidemiologist Walter Orenstein observes, ""vaccines which remain in the vial are 0 percent effective."" It is vaccinations, not vaccines, that save lives.

This seems simplistic, I know. It is certainly simple, and yet somehow it still needs to be said.

Far too much of our public health messaging around the vaccines has been negative, as David Leonhardt has compellingly argued at The New York Times. ""Right now, public discussion of the vaccines is full of warnings about their limitations,"" Leonhardt writes. ""They're not 100 percent effective. Even vaccinated people may be able to spread the virus. And people shouldn't change their behavior once they get their shots."" These warnings have a ""basis in truth,"" he adds, but their collective impression is deeply — dangerously — misleading. They're adding to the very fears discussion of the vaccines should be relieving.

""We're underselling the vaccine,"" one expert told Leonhardt. ""It's driving me a little bit crazy,"" said another. A third: ""It's going to save your life — that's where the emphasis has to be right now.""

There are two very different sources for the underselling Leonhardt describes. One is what we saw with the Trump administration: unjustified skepticism of vaccines generally, of the COVID-19 vaccine specifically, and (somehow, after 400,000 deaths even with all the lockdowns and distancing and so on) the reality of COVID-19 itself. This is the mindset encouraged by an ex-president apparently unwilling to get his own shot even though it might enhance his personal immunity and convince millions of his followers this vaccination is safe and desirable.

The temptation for the Biden administration will be the opposite extreme, what critics have dubbed ""doomerism."" This is the perspective in which all risk is unacceptable, the mindset that last spring castigated Floridians for taking perfectly safe walks on the beach and now produces headlines like, ""Vaccinated Brits told not to hug kids amid fears millions will ignore COVID rules once they have jab."" However good the intentions here, any health message to the general public which says to refuse to hug your children indefinitely even after vaccination — and the article doesn't specify adult children in a separate household; it seems to be a blanket directive — should be a non-starter. It is utterly hopeless. Perhaps nothing is more certain to push an already-anxious public into pandemic nihilism and dismissal of vaccination as useless or worse.

The goal in the public health response to this pandemic never was (or never should have been) no risk. That is unachievable, particularly for the great bulk of the public without the luxury of working from home and outsourcing risk to delivery drivers. No, the goal was managed, informed, minimal risk with adequate medical capacity until the vaccine arrived. Think harm reduction for the real world, not all-or-nothing maximalism with which many are unwilling or unable to comply.

And at this stage, the best way to reduce harm is ""accepting a more positive vaccine message,"" as Josh Barro writes at Business Insider. The worry ""driving cautious vaccine messaging is that if we tell people too positive a story about the vaccine, they'll go nuts with transmission risks as soon as they've been injected,"" Barro observes. (This is the exact reason cited in the ""don't hug your kids"" piece.) ""There's one problem with this worry,"" he continues: ""People have already gone nuts with the transmission risks. Look around you. In most of the country, COVID is spreading like wildfire."" The priority now is to get vaccines in arms, and that will happen faster if we stop underselling them.

Messaging, of course, is not the only concern. The other is the actual distribution logistics, in which it's not yet clear the Biden administration's plan will be substantially better than the Trump administration's alleged non-plan. The timeline we've heard — and hoped for — was full vaccination for all who want it by mid-summer, but Biden's goal (per the 10 pandemic-related executive orders he signed Thursday) is only 100 million vaccine doses distributed in his first 100 days. As each vaccination requires two doses, that's just 50 million people, less than a sixth of the country, vaccinated by May 1. It's barely faster than what we're already doing. It's not enough.

Almost a year in, we need to be able to see how the pandemic ends. The wonderful thing is an ending that consists of fast delivery of good vaccines is possible, and an ending like that can make the final wait more bearable, vaccination more widely acceptable, and the last stretch of compliance (including the six weeks required for two vaccine doses to take full effect) more feasible. This is the story the Biden administration should be telling — and making a reality."	-15.18
"Wildlife veterinarian Stephen Ngulu starts his typical working day watching from a distance as the chimpanzees under his care eat their breakfast. He keeps an eye out for runny noses, coughing, or other hints of illness.

These days, Ngulu and others at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy's Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Kenya have doubled down on their vigilance.

Chimpanzees and other great apes — orangutans, gorillas, and bonobos — are prone to many human viruses and other infections that plague people. So when SARS-CoV-2 began circulating, the community that studies and cares for great apes grew worried.

""We don't know what will happen if the virus is transmitted to the great apes. It might get severe,"" says Fabian Leendertz, an infectious-disease ecologist at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin. These endangered apes have the same receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter human cells — angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) — making infection a distinct possibility. What's less predictable is how sick the apes might get were the virus to take hold.

Genetic similarities — we share at least 96 percent of our DNA with each great ape species — mean that apes are susceptible to many viruses and bacteria that infect human beings. And though some human pathogens (such as a coronavirus called HCoV-OC43 that causes some cases of the common cold) cause only minor illness in the animals, others can be disastrous. ""There have been incidents of common human respiratory pathogens spilling into chimpanzees, and it's fatal to them,"" says Fransiska Sulistyo, an orangutan veterinary consultant in Indonesia.

Between 1999 and 2006, for example, several outbreaks of respiratory disease occurred among chimpanzees in the Ivory Coast's Taï National Park, including a 2004 episode that infected a group of 44 and killed eight. Analyses suggest that the underlying pathogens were human respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus, which both cause respiratory illnesses in people, along with secondary bacterial infections. And in 2013, rhinovirus C, a cause of the human common cold, caused an outbreak among 56 wild chimpanzees in Uganda's Kibale National Park, killing five.

Even in normal times, those who work at ape sanctuaries or study apes in the wild are perpetually trying to stave off disease. Guidelines from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recommend that field researchers and sanctuary staff coming from other countries quarantine for at least a week before entering ape habitat, in the wild or otherwise. They should wear face masks and stay at least seven meters away from apes. The IUCN also recommends that people working with apes stay up to date on immunizations, get screened for infectious diseases of regional concern (tuberculosis and hepatitis, for example), and watch for signs of illness in research staff. Sanctuaries should routinely disinfect surfaces within their facilities.

Measures instituted at the J.A.C.K. chimpanzee sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the pandemic include protective gear for staff. Many also travel to work via foot or bicycle rather than public transportation to limit exposure to COVID-19. | ( J.A.C.K. SANCTUARY/Courtesy Knowable Magazine)

Such practices have been common for years, says anthropologist Michael Muehlenbein of Baylor University, who wrote about the risks of ecotourism to apes and other wild animals in the Annual Review of Anthropology. ""They just now need to be applied more vigilantly."" But, he adds, the IUCN's guidelines are only recommendations. Enforcement responsibility rests on sanctuaries and research groups.

The Sweetwaters sanctuary employs such practices, veterinarian Ngulu says. But in February 2019, he got a taste of what might happen if a virus like SARS-CoV-2 broke through. A severe respiratory outbreak — probably spread from an asymptomatic worker infected by some bacterial or viral pathogen — had affected all 39 of the sanctuary's chimpanzees, and two died. ""From that experience last year, I can say I was baptized by fire,"" he says.

With the emergence of COVID-19, it was clear that Sweetwaters needed to further tighten protocols. To that end, it has closed visitor areas and suspended volunteer activities and allows only necessary staff into the sanctuary. Workers returning from leave quarantine at the staff camp for 14 days instead of immediately resuming work, then remain at the sanctuary for a month at a time, until another staff member comes to relieve them.

Measures also have tightened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the local wildlife authority locked down a chimpanzee sanctuary called J.A.C.K. (a French acronym that stands for young animals confiscated in Katanga) from April through August. ""Our team made huge sacrifices away from their families,"" says Roxane Couttenier, J.A.C.K. founder and one of the sanctuary managers. ""Chimpanzees are known for having fragile lungs, and because the coronavirus is brand new, it was obvious we had to protect them.""

Although staff now can go home between shifts, they take extra precautions before returning to work, like changing face masks before entering the sanctuary and traveling by foot or bicycle to avoid crowded buses.

Orangutan sanctuaries in Indonesia have also been in lockdown, says Sulistyo. They've limited staff on site, and those staff aren't permitted to leave the local town. They've arranged the orangutans into what scientists call epidemiological groups, akin to the COVID pods that people have formed with friends and family. That way, if an orangutan becomes infected, staff can limit further spread.

Economic effects of the pandemic — a global recession, no tourism — have hit the sanctuaries hard. At Sweetwaters, staff have taken at least a 20 percent pay cut while working more hours. Ngulu says there's less money to buy food for the chimps and disinfectants and personal protective equipment for staff. At the orangutan facilities, Sulistyo says, ""they've had to close and cut staff,"" affecting the standard of care.

The pandemic has shut down or reduced work at many field sites, slowing the pace of research, Leendertz says. In the case of his own group, which tracks pathogens circulating in nonhuman primate populations in the Ivory Coast, the bare minimum of staff is on site. ""There are still people collecting data because it's important to keep monitoring those populations,"" he says.

Wherever people and great apes share a common environment, there will be a risk of exchanging pathogens, says George Omondi, former deputy manager and head veterinarian at Sweetwaters and now an epidemiologist and wildlife veterinarian researcher at the University of Minnesota. ""Every sanctuary exists in the continuum of a community,"" he says.

And so a growing number of experts favor what is known as a One Health approach, the better to protect all of us. Keeping local human populations healthy and tracking human diseases can prevent transmission of dangerous pathogens to apes. And monitoring disease in apes and implementing protective health measures at the reserves and sanctuaries prevent pathogens from jumping from apes to the people who work with them, and from there to the broader community.

""We cannot only focus on great ape health,"" Leendertz says. ""We have to look at the human population, the entire picture, while still trying to protect the great apes."""	-15.18
"Senate Democrats have a bare majority in the new Congress — 50 seats, plus Vice President Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker. It's the first time the party has had control of both houses of Congress and the presidency in a decade.

But the leader of the Senate Republicans, Mitch McConnell, is already plotting to throttle this government in the crib. He is demanding Democrats preserve his ability to block anything they propose with the Senate filibuster, so he can ruin the country and blame it on them, and he is gambling that moderate Democratic senators will be too scared to call his bluff. Democrats should tell McConnell to go pound sand, and nuke the filibuster right now.

To understand what McConnell is doing, a bit of background on Senate procedure is required. The Senate does not formally change its rules for each new Congress, since only a third of its members are up for re-election in any particular cycle. So in normal times, the body votes through a Simple Resolution detailing how the majority party will fill up the committees, select chairmen, and so on, and everything else remains the same.

However, this time we have a tied Senate, meaning Vice President Harris gives Democrats control with her tie-breaking vote. In this circumstance — most recently for six months in 2001 — the Senate has passed a different Organizing Resolution to organize itself. This is a sort of power-sharing arrangement with different details given that there may be ties at the committee level and such.

Recall that the filibuster allows just 41 senators to block most legislation. Activists have begged Democrats to get rid of the filibuster after witnessing McConnell use it to shamelessly obstruct Democratic priorities and then immediately remove it as an obstacle to his own chief priority, confirming right-wing Supreme Court Justices. Yet so far a crucial segment of moderate Democratic senators have resisted, for reasons of ""tradition,"" or worries it will force them to take difficult votes, or simple timidity. Now McConnell has broken yet another Senate norm by threatening to filibuster the Organizing Resolution unless Democrats agree to keep the legislative filibuster for the next two years. To the best of my knowledge, filibustering the initial organizational rule package in a new Congress has never happened before. (Incidentally, since the Senate will continue to operate under its current rules, that leaves Republicans in charge of the committees so long as it is not passed.)

If Democrats agree, given McConnell's history, he is virtually guaranteed to not allow any normal legislation through, and to drag out the confirmation of any appointee as long as possible. The only way to pass any law will be through the cumbersome and limited reconciliation process. Just as he did under President Obama, McConnell wants to throw sand in the gears of government, prevent Biden from accomplishing anything, blame Democrats for the resulting dysfunction, and take back full control of the Senate in two years.

The obvious solution here would be to call McConnell's bluff and simply get rid of the filibuster now. There is no reason why the Senate can't pass laws through majority vote, as virtually every other legislative body on Earth does. (Indeed, the Senate is already ridiculously biased towards a handful of small states even without the 60-vote requirement.) As Akhil Reed Amar argues at length in Duke Law Journal, it is both legal and constitutional for Democrats to invoke Rule 20, which outlines how questions of procedure are adjudicated, to amend the rules and delete the filibuster through a simple majority vote. Then they pass the Organizing Resolution with that same majority. The Senate rulebook, precedent, and the Constitution all agree that ultimately a Senate majority must be able to decide at any point how the body should be organized.

This is the so-called ""nuclear option,"" and indeed happened in 2013 under then-Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), when Democrats got rid of the filibuster for ordinary judicial nominations. It happened again under McConnell himself in 2017, when Republicans got rid of it for Supreme Court nominations. One should also note at this point that, contrary to the fake history of the filibuster as some time-honored Senate tradition, its creation was entirely accidental and, prior to McConnell establishing it as a routine occurrence, was mainly used by white supremacists to block civil rights legislation.

So far, even moderate Senate Democrats don't seem to be buying McConnell's gambit. They want to preserve at least the threat of nuking the filibuster as leverage for getting things passed. Yet many of them clearly still don't want to get rid of it altogether. But if they don't, the chance of passing almost any bill through normal order will be dead for the next two years. Count on it.

So in a way, it might be lucky that McConnell is forcing Democrats to face this choice right out of the gate. If they just rip off the band-aid, they can pass what laws they like and let the 2022 electorate judge them on that, rather than trying to beat Republicans in a game of blame avoidance. Let's give democracy a chance."	-15.18
"The Weeknd is spending $7 million of his own money on this year's extra-long Super Bowl halftime show

Things that will take less time than watching the Weeknd's Super Bowl halftime show: baking cupcakes, a rerun of Seinfeld, and saving 15 percent or more on car insurance with the company known for its funny commercials starring an anthropomorphic gecko. According to Billboard, this year's Super Bowl performance will be twice as long as usual, clocking in at 24 minutes, because the halftime show sponsor, Pepsi, is cutting down on its commercials during the game. ""We've been really focusing on dialing in on the fans at home and making performances a cinematic experience, and we want to do that with the Super Bowl,"" the Weeknd said, and his co-manager revealed that the singer personally put up $7 million of his own money to ""make this halftime show be what he envisioned.""

"The Republican Party represents regular working stiffs, the forgotten men and women of America, who have been left behind by the country's effete liberal elites. Or at least that's the message that President Trump, GOP leadership, and the American right in general have been pushing for years. But while their words are one thing, their actions are another. And the actions of Trump and his fellow Republicans during the coronavirus pandemic suggest they see American workers as nothing but cannon fodder to be sacrificed in the name of a rejuvenated economy.

The most recent example was the president's executive order from earlier this week, telling meatpacking plants to remain open. The industry, which involves thousands of often poorly-paid workers laboring shoulder to shoulder to process and package poultry, pork, and other items, has become a hotspot for COVID-19 outbreaks. Facilities are shutting down, at least 20 workers in meat and food processing have died, and thousands have either been infected or had to self-quarantine. Pork and beef processing has already fallen 25 percent, and the Trump administration was concerned capacity could be cut by as much as 80 percent. The president's decision was no doubt influenced by an ad taken out by the chairman of Tyson Foods this weekend, warning that America's food supply chain ""is breaking.""

Trump's order comes from his authority under the Defense Production Act (DPA). I've written myself about how Trump needs to put the DPA to much wider use to rationalize the economic production of crucial needs like ventilators, tests, masks and gloves. Food is obviously a crucial need too. (You could debate how crucial meat specifically is, but set that aside for now.) The challenge of the coronavirus pandemic is that going to work is now risky for both individuals and the community, but some work must still be done for society to function. It just has to be done as safely as possible.

That's where Trump's order turns ominous. Reporting suggests vague promises from the White House that the government will provide additional protective gear and safety guidance to the meatpacking industry. But thus far the White House's record on both counts is pretty appalling. Trump's executive efforts to get tests and masks and ventilators to the country at large have amounted to irresponsible and incompetent bedlam. Meanwhile, the executive agency tasked with overseeing workers' well-being, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), has effectively checked out during the coronavirus pandemic.

The agency has received thousands of complaints from Americans about dangerous conditions at their places of work. But thus far OSHA hasn't bothered giving employers hard rules for coronavirus safety — instead releasing purely voluntary guidelines, while leaving enforcement with teeth to under-resourced state governments. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has, of course, lobbied against any actual enforceable regulations. And even though Democrats tried to pass new enforceable safety standards legislatively, Republicans aren't having it. Nor is the Trump administration requiring employers outside of the health sector to track and report COVID-19 cases at their worksites.

This is a picture of an administration and a political party that is simply indifferent to the practical challenges of keeping workers safe during the coronavirus pandemic. But it doesn't end there.

In its announcement of the meatpacking order, the White House also made vague mentions of ""liability protections"" for employers — which, in plain English, seems to mean preventing workers in the industry from being able to sue their employers over any negative consequences of being made to work in unsafe conditions. If the administration actually did intend to impose substantive safety requirements on the industry, that protection might be understandable. But all the evidence suggests otherwise. Even worse, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) now wants to provide protection from coronavirus-related lawsuits to all employers across the country.

Workers and customers are apparently beginning to sue companies for not taking the proper safety precautions, thus putting people at risk of infection. The business community has quietly pushed lawmakers to crack down on the trend, and McConnell just told Fox News that he wants to make any federal aid to state budgets conditional on state governments also protecting employers from lawsuits. The logic here is straightforwardly coldblooded: The coronavirus pandemic remains a real threat to workers, vast majorities of Americans approve of the continued lockdowns and are afraid to resume normal social activity, so if the economy is to reopen — as Trump and his supporters want — then workers must be stripped of any power to hold their employers accountable. The measures needed to make work safe during the coronavirus pandemic are costly, after all, and will eat into profits.

Indeed, workers must be effectively forced to return to the job, which brings us to unemployment insurance. One of the most important parts of the CARES Act was a major boost to unemployment benefits, to keep individuals and families financially whole as the state-wide shutdowns eliminated jobs. The catch is, to be eligible for unemployment benefits, a person must have lost their job involuntarily. In other words, once a state ends its stay-at-home orders, workers who decide to remain away from their jobs for fear of the coronavirus will not be eligible for unemployment insurance.

A number of states have either already commenced partial reopenings of their economies, or their stay-at-home orders end this month. Not all of these governors are Republicans, and some of these states have said they will adjust the rules for their unemployment systems. But Republican-dominated states like Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina are known for having pretty stingy and ruthless unemployment systems to begin with. And at least some GOP governors have explicitly said that, yes, Americans must go back to work once the lockdowns end. ""If you're an employer and you offer to bring your employee back to work and they decide not to, that's a voluntary quit,"" Iowa's Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds said. ""Therefore, they would not be eligible for the unemployment money.""

So let's add all this up. In the meatpacking industry, President Trump is ordering Americans back to dangerous work sites, with no evidence they'll be given adequate protection. Meanwhile, Republicans and their big-business constituents want to reopen the economy, and use the threat of financial destitution to coerce people into returning to work, whether they think it's safe or not. Lastly, not only is the GOP uninterested in using the government's power to force employers to take proper precautions, they want to stop the courts from forcing employers to do so as well. ""Work under the shadow of coronavirus, or starve"" seems to be the order the Republican Party wants to give the country, with no guarantee of safety other than the cost-benefit analysis of employers' consciences.

"The Payroll Protection Program, the massive plan Congress passed to help small businesses during the coronavirus economic crisis, has not had the best time of it. The PPP's rollout was a logistical mess, then it ran out of money way too soon and had to be restocked by a second bill. Now it turns out a fair number of ""small businesses"" that weren't actually all that small gobbled up some of the funding.

The burger chain Shake Shack, which has 120 locations and $100 million in cash to burn, got $10 million from the PPP. Ruth's Hospitality Group, which owns a successful steakhouse chain, got $20 million. The Los Angeles Lakers, who technically fall under the PPP's 500-employees-or-less threshold, but who are also worth about $3.7 billion, got a $4.6 million loan from the program. These news stories sparked widespread outrage, and those companies have since said they would return the loans. But other big companies that slipped in are holding onto their money.

As justified as the anger over these companies carving off slices of the PPP is, it should also be directed at the proper target: How lawmakers designed the Payroll Protection Program in the first place. More specifically, the two key problems are how the PPP was funded, and how actual access to the program worked at the institutional level.

First off, Congress shouldn't have limited PPP funding to a specific dollar amount.

Technically, what the PPP did was provide loans to small businesses via the private banking system. But the idea was that the bulk of the loans would be forgiven so long as the companies used 75 percent of the loans they got to cover payroll expenses and keep their workers employed. That effectively turned most of the loans into one-way grants, which meant Congress needed to provide the money to backstop the one-way transfer. The initial bill gave the program $350 billion to work with, then the second infusion added another $310 billion.

Those loans were designed to cover two and a half months of payroll, but even a cursory glance at small businesses' payroll expenses over that time frame should've made it clear that $350 billion was a woefully inadequate amount. The additional $310 billion is probably still a woefully inadequate amount. Instead, Congress should've just made the program open-ended, without any dollar cap at all. Preserving small businesses through the coronavirus crisis is a specific goal, and we should've designed the PPP to spend however much was necessary to achieve that goal.

Unfortunately, Congress has a lot of people in both parties — though Republicans especially — who are (wrongly) fixated on limiting federal borrowing. So open-ended spending on the PPP was a no-go. The problem is that, if you preemptively limit the pot of money on offer, of course the most powerful of the eligible businesses will get to it first, with nothing but their own consciences to stop them. And a lot of the most vulnerable small businesses will get nothing at all.

Now, it's technically not clear how much of the PPP funding these bigger ""small businesses"" depleted; Forbes looked at 71 publicly traded companies that got loans through the PPP, and their slice only accounted for 0.09 percent of the money available. But the fact that they got help while many, many smaller businesses got nothing at all points to the inherent absurdity of a spending cap on the program.

The second problem was the actual pathway used to deliver the PPP loan. Congress may have authorized the program, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) may have overseen it with help from the Treasury Department, but it was private banks that originated the loans and handled the actual interactions with the firms that applied for them. And that meant the businesses most likely to get the best, fastest service were the ones that had taken out loans from the banks before, and had good relationships established with the banks already. (That the SBA is a relatively small agency not known for efficiency didn't help either, nor did the archaic web portals and systems it provided the banks for administering the PPP.) This inevitably meant companies that were on the bigger, wealthier, and better connected end of the small business population. It also meant small businesses that come from more privileged populations: Black and Latino small businesses have historically been shut out of and ignored by the financial system to a disproportionate degree, and reports suggest the distribution of the Payroll Protection Program's funds was no different. (Though the Treasury Department is not officially tracking that data.)

There were other institutional pipelines lawmakers could've used that didn't run through the SBA and the private banks. They could've just skipped the whole concept of originating the money as loans that are then forgiven, and relied on the Treasury Department to directly provide the money as grants through something like the payroll system that small businesses already have to interact with. In the House, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) has a bill that would more or less do just that, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and others in the Senate have similar companion legislation.

There were other problems, too. Insisting that 75 percent of the PPP loans be used to cover payroll left out a lot of small businesses whose expenses are mainly location or facilities or other physical capital. Better to just tell businesses that all the money is free and they can use it however they want, as long as they keep everyone on payroll. The PPP also explicitly looked at individual locations to meet the 500-workers-or-less threshold, as opposed to the overall company, which is how the big chain restaurants snuck in there.

It was also cumbersome for Congress to design two different rescue packages — one for ""small"" businesses and one for ""big"" ones. It should've just done one big package that covered everyone. As with money aid to individuals and households, money aid to companies tends to work better when the program is as simple and universal as possible. Jayapal's bill would move things closer to that goal in some of these other ways as well.

Obviously, standing up a giant rescue package for millions of companies in the midst of a pandemic and an economic collapse is no easy feat. But Congress also committed a lot of unforced errors with the Payroll Protection Program. Now America's small businesses must live with the consequences of those mistakes — the smallest and least privileged businesses most of all.

"Vice President Mike Pence could effectively and immediately fire President Trump by convincing a handful of Trump's Cabinet to invoke Article 4 of the 25th Amendment. By the time Trump appealed, he would already be out of office. Congressional Democrats are publicly urging Pence to take this step — in fact, if he does not, the House will impeach Trump for a second time.

There would be something remarkably neat about Pence being acting president for one week. Trump's term ending with an acting president would be a poetic finale for a man who prefers his Cabinet not hindered by Senate confirmation. America would certainly appreciate the flexibility.

Would Pence do it? He is keeping it as an option, in case Trump becomes ""more unstable"" in his last 10 days in office, CNN reports. But he clearly does not want to take this step, and the conventional wisdom is he won't.

Pence should not only do it, he should take inspiration from the slur running rampant across pro-Trump internet forums, that he is already Judas to Trump's Jesus.

Pence obviously knows the story of Judas Iscariot, but for anyone who doesn't, he is the friend and apostle who sold Jesus to his executioners for 30 pieces of silver, then killed himself in remorse. Not exactly an inspiring role model — Dante puts him in the final circle of hell, being eternally chewed apart by Satan.

But Pence should consider this about Judas: Whatever noble and good things you do in your life, you will forever be remembered for your last big act. And this is Pence's moment in history. Gerald Ford isn't remembered for his college football career or stint as House minority leader — he is and always will be the vice president who took over when Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace, then pardoned him.

Mike Pence will be an ignoble footnote, a historical curiosity — or he will be a legend.

Pence does not appear to be a particularly principled man, though he likes to play-act one. The best explanation for his unswerving loyalty to Trump, through scandal after scandal, is that he is hoping to inherit Trump's political mantle. That dream is over. He is both tainted by his association with Trump and despised by the Trump wing of the Republican Party. After Trump publicly excoriated Pence for not attempting to seize the election for him during a joint session of Congress to tally President-elect Joe Biden's win, a mob of Trump supporters marched on and broke into the U.S. Capitol literally calling for Pence's head. And they brought their own scaffold and noose.

Pence owes Trump nothing.

Of course, the best thing for the country at this point would be for Trump to resign. He has lost his party, his office, and his aura of political teflon. And he is widely regarded as a danger to American democracy and national security. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Trump ally, said Sunday he would vote to impeach Trump for inciting insurrection. A handful of Republican senators have publicly called for him to step down and probably don't want to have to vote on conviction.

Trump leaving on his own terms would also be the best thing for Trump, as Andrew McCarthy argues at National Review. The House will impeach him, and if the Senate were to convict him — either before he's out of office or, more likely, afterward, when Democrats take control — he will lose the thing he loves in life as much as fame: money. Specifically, his $200,000-a-year-for-life presidential pension, about $1 million in annual travel expenses, Secret Service protection, and other perks. And he probably won't be able to run for office again, should the political winds shift.

But ""Trump would only abandon the presidency if he felt he had no other choice, most likely because staying put would thrust him into legal trouble,"" CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang writes at Politico. ""Or, if he had something to gain that he couldn't turn down, such as a pardon by the vice president. Neither is the case. Besides, there is nothing Trump dislikes more than a loser. A resignation would amount to quitting, and he views quitters as losers.""

In that sense, Pence forcing out Trump may actually be Trump's best viable hope. A win-win-win.

The hard thing about the Judas narrative is that the most despised figure in the New Testament is also a necessary part of the Jesus resurrection story. Without Judas or some other traitor, Jesus isn't crucified, died, buried, and risen again — and there is no Christianity. It is absurd to compare Trump to Jesus of Nazareth, but if you are inclined toward that particular blasphemy, the 25th Amendment would at least allow Trump the possibility of rising from the political ashes of his own profane immolation."	-15.18
"Donald Trump can be quite funny.

President Trump, however, was rarely funny.

Comedy isn't really in a president's lengthy job description — they are supposed to tell pre-written jokes at events like the White House Corespondents' Dinner and Al Smith Dinner, and some presidents have been good at that, but Trump was not. His comedy skills veer toward the insult comic variety. When presidents mock people, they are almost always punching down.

Trump was a boon to comedians, though, at least at first. As with national newspapers and cable TV, his attention-demanding tweets, firings, ethical lapses, palace intrigues, feuds, peccadillos, and, occasionally, policies were good for the comedy business. When things are bleak, people need to laugh. And comedy can be next to sunlight in denuding kakistocracy and overweening power.

So during the Trump era, late-night comedy shows, always peppered with jokes about political leaders, became political comedy. Mocking Trump helped make Stephen Colbert's Late Show the top late-night program, surpassing The Tonight Show, where Jimmy Fallon's softer jabs didn't match the moment, even with his elaborate Trump impersonation. Jimmy Kimmel, who wasn't all that political before Trump, actually shifted the debate on health care and pre-existing conditions, plausibly helping to sink the GOP's big effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act.

Late Night's Seth Meyers came up with his Closer Looks at whatever corrupt abominations Trump was cooking up, Last Week Tonight's John Oliver became bleak, and Full Frontal's Samantha Bee raged against the machine and the dying light. At The Daily Show — the pioneer of late-night political satire — apartheid-forged Trevor Noah managed to keep some semblance of balance. Conan O'Brien marched to his own drummer.

All of this worked for a while, but like Trump's own constant demands on our attention, it started getting old. And when the pandemic hit and forced comedians to tape from home, the material became less funny — for obvious reasons — and the lack of audiences laid bare what was already becoming evident: Late-night TV was starting to become just another extension of the political news industrial complex.

You could see it wearing on comedians. You could feel it wearing on America. Everyone seems angry, and that's not funny. If we were laughing at all, it was to keep ourselves from crying.

Like Trump or hate him, it's not healthy for anyone to have their lives so wrapped up in the moods and whimsies of a self-obsessed ruler. Worse, whether you liked Trump or hated him became more important to some people than ties of kinship and friendship. It was too much. I'm not sure how we would have survived another four years of it. Because America chose President-elect Joe Biden, we don't have to find out.

""Years from now, this might be difficult to explain: the way entire days got yoked to one person's rants, reactions, cruelties, refusals, jokes, tangents, and to just thinking so often about the president,"" Katherine Miller wrote at BuzzFeed News soon after Biden was declared the winner. ""Even weirder, and more difficult, would be explaining how an entire country became accustomed to living inside one person's head.""

Amid all this chaos and dissonance, ""some people reasonably view the prevailing lesson, or at least the ethos, of the last decade as: Nothing matters,"" Miller argued. ""The idea is a breezy nihilism, or at least an ironic nihilism to mask a bruised-heartedness,"" and when you realize that everything matters after all — hasn't this year proved that? — ""it's this overwhelming crack-your-heart-open experience.""

We're about to hit another very grim part of the COVID-19 pandemic, way too many people are jobless and hungry, and we remain a bitterly divided nation. Getting to the point where Americans can open their hearts and really laugh again — with each other, not at each other — will take time.

It will also probably require some Trump detox. Americans might consider embracing their personal freedom to stop caring about the president's feelings, moods, threats, manic ups, occasional downs, his evidently bottomless need for public shows of affection and fealty. If you can free up that headspace, think of all the natural lightness you might replace it with.

Will we laugh at Joe Biden? Absolutely. But presumably it will be when he does something funny, intentionally or more likely unintentionally. While it may seem hard to remember, there is a lot of other stuff to laugh at in this world.

Laughter may not be the best medicine, but maybe we should give it a try."	-15.18
"President Trump wants a deal. Mitch McConnell won't let him have one.

Trump, down double digits in the polls less than three weeks before Election Day, has upped his offer in long-simmering COVID-19 stimulus talks to $1.8 trillion, and he had his surrogates tell the Sunday talk shows he could go higher. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who also wants a deal, is down to $2.2 trillion. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Wall Street, and most mainstream economists agree a large jolt of government aid is the only prescription for preventing a drawn-out, slow economic recovery and even greater wreckage for U.S. businesses large and small.

McConnell, the Senate majority leader, is grudgingly offering $500 billion. Trump's response?

STIMULUS! Go big or go home!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2020

MConnell will go home. He won't consider the bigger price tag on offer from Pelosi and Trump's lead negotiator, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, because his caucus doesn't want to authorize that much spending. Whether it's latent fiscal conservatism, concerns about 2022 or 2024 primary challenges, or doubts that they will be in control next year, Senate Republicans are not interested in sending checks with Trump's name on them to American voters before Nov. 3.

Trump is. And he really only has one piece of leverage over McConnell, if he's bold enough to use it.

To get any deal negotiated by Pelosi and Mnuchin through the Senate, McConnell would have to rely on Senate Democrats, a step he is loath to take. His driving animus is keeping his job as majority leader — and confirming conservative judges to lifetime appointments. And therein lies the key to Trump's October surprise.

McConnell loves confirming judges. We know this from his behavior, and we know this because Trump told us so. ""You know what Mitch's biggest thing is in the whole world? His judges,"" Trump told journalist Bob Woodward on tape earlier this year. McConnell ""will absolutely ask me, 'Please, let's get the judge approved instead of 10 ambassadors.'""

Trump likes confirming conservative judges because the people who support him like that he confirms conservative judges, but that's not his passion. He likes to win. He also wants the stock market to go up, U.S. government checks and gift cards to go to voters, and to been seen making deals. Dealmaking is kind of his thing. By thwarting his deal, McConnell is making Trump look weak.

The one hand Trump has to play is Amy Coney Barrett. Presidents appoint Supreme Court justices, if the Senate gives them consent. Senate Republicans will almost certainly rush Barrett's nomination through to Trump's desk before Election Day, but McConnell can't seat her on the bench. This is the big prize, what McConnell lives for — and Trump can take it away.

The president wouldn't have to withdraw Barrett's nomination — he wants her confirmed, too. But he could suspend it, put it on hold, let McConnell know that there won't be a Justice Amy Coney Barrett unless McConnell pushes through, say, $2 trillion in stimulus funds.

Is an enduring 6-3 conservative Supreme Court majority worth $2 trillion of other people's money to Mitch McConnell? There's only one way to find out.

The final stretch of the 2020 presidential race isn't going well for Trump. He's clearly on track to become the first one-term president since George Herbert Walker Bush — and he has been for months, maybe years. Dirty tricks might gain him a point or two in the polls, but not enough to close the gap with Democrat Joe Biden. Outfoxing Mitch McConnell might not either, but honestly, it's his best shot.

"Maryland man finds his calling in retirement, fixing hundreds of bikes at no charge

Neighbors, friends, strangers, it doesn't matter — Ric Jackson fixes any bike that comes his way, free of charge. Jackson, a retired mathematician and avid cyclist, lives in Potomac, Maryland. Last April, one of his neighbors was looking for someone to fix the brakes on his daughter's bike, and Jackson offered to help. When he was finished, the father and daughter were both ""thrilled"" with the results, Jackson told CBS News. That was his first fix of the pandemic — since then, Jackson has repaired more than 650 bikes for people he knows, as well as others who find him through word of mouth. Kids are often in awe when he takes their broken bikes and returns them good as new, Jackson said, and he regularly receives texts from people praising his handiwork and telling him about the great bike ride they just went on, thanks to him.

"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18

"The Mandalorian just aired a jaw-dropping season finale. But it felt more like a series finale.

At the end of a ridiculously jam-packed second season, in the excellent final episode ""The Rescue,"" The Mandalorian still had one last surprise (spoiler alert!): an appearance by Luke Skywalker. Even more wild, though, is the state the show itself is left in, leaving fans with the question of how on Earth it can go forward — and more importantly, now that it has seemingly resolved its primary conflict, can it keep casual viewers on board?

Throughout season 2, The Mandalorian had a clear goal: reunite the child, Grogu, with his own kind, the Jedi. Yet it seemed unlikely the Mandalorian would be successful, at least not yet. For one, this would potentially require sending Grogu away to be trained by Luke but ultimately murdered by Kylo Ren, as Star Wars: The Last Jedi established a grim fate for most of Luke's students down the line. Baby Yoda is undoubtedly the star of the show and the entire reason The Mandalorian became a pop culture phenomenon. Lucasfilm wouldn't seriously consider reducing his role in any way, would they?

Yet against all odds, season 2's finale ends with Grogu going off to be trained by Luke. There are seemingly no complications with this plan, and the show even provides the tear-jerking emotional payoff many assumed would be saved for the very end of the series: the Mandalorian removing his helmet to reveal his face to Grogu and say goodbye.

So, uh, now what? The Mandalorian has already been renewed for a third season, but did Lucasfilm just pull the biggest swerve in recent TV history by surprise ending it early? Assuming that's not the case, it seems season 3 can focus on the retaking of Mandalore, with Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) as a lead character. There's also the post-credits stinger, which adds to the confusion by showing Boba Fett returning to Jabba's palace as text on screen declares, ""THE BOOK OF BOBA FETT. COMING DECEMBER 2021."" Is this meant to indicate a previously-unannounced Boba Fett spinoff series is coming? Or is season 3 itself ""The Book of Boba Fett,"" and it won't involve Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) as much?

A fully Mandalore-driven season or a Boba Fett-driven season would each be concerning for the long-term viability of the series. Since its first episode, The Mandalorian succeeded primarily because of the relationship between Grogu and Din, the driving force that keeps each adventure churning. The Star Wars nerds love the Easter eggs and cameos, but remove the bond between the two central characters and you remove the beating heart of the story. Already, there had been some concern that season two was leaning too heavily into fan service, but the reason the show never took it too far was because this heart remained intact. The season's penultimate episode ""The Believer"" proved Grogu doesn't always have to be on screen, but even then, his presence was felt, and viewers were on the edge of their seats because of just how darn invested we were in seeing the kid safe.

Now that he is safe and has been shuffled off screen with Luke, a third season about retaking Mandalore seems like it would mostly be of interest to the longtime fans who know Bo-Katan from Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels. The Mandalorian himself doesn't appear as driven to accomplish that goal, or really any specific goal now that Grogu has been returned. Since it's not clear that the Mandalorian actually wants to reclaim this apparent wasteland of a planet that Mandalorian viewers have never actually seen, will that idea really hook general audiences?

Then there's the Boba Fett plot. It made sense to bring Boba back from the dead, but there was a fear among some fans that he would overshadow Din and end up taking over The Mandalorian. If the credits stinger really is meant to tease season 3 and not a separate spinoff (the more common interpretation is the latter), that could literally happen. This would be a big disappointment considering the work this show has put into establishing a brand new character rather than just trotting out an old one.

Other seeds planted for the future of Star Wars TV include Ahsoka Tano facing off against Grand Admiral Thrawn, likely in her own spinoff Ahsoka, but that's once again mostly intriguing for Rebels fans after a Thrawn-related cliffhanger from that show. Diving further into the threat of the imperial remnant that will eventually lead to the First Order, on the other hand, is something for everyone else to look forward to, but the finale doesn't exactly spend much time teasing that.

Is it possible The Mandalorian will simply bring Grogu back immediately at the start of season 3? Maybe. Perhaps there will be a time jump and all of his training will take place off screen, or perhaps there will be some reason he ends up cutting off his training early. But now that Grogu's been placed in the care of Luke freaking Skywalker, getting him back into the hands of the Mandalorian might be a bit strained. Even if the next step in their journey could be returning Grogu to the planet of Yoda's species, surely Luke could take care of that, right?

It's easy to imagine several more years of stories about the Mandalorian's adventures caring for Grogu — heck, there could have been a whole season just about trying to rescue him from Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) — so offering this resolution after just two brief seasons is an unexpected choice. Certainly, Luacsfilm is taking a big swing with this quasi-series finale, and there's a risk that after such a satisfying ending, casual viewers will tune out for good. Producers Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni better have a good plan for ensuring they don't."	-15.18
"Growing up just outside of Buffalo, New York, Sunday occasionally meant football. More often, it meant my dad settling into his recliner and turning on the Bills game, snorting a few times, and then switching off the TV after the first quarter. He, my mom, and I would then head to a craft show and look at some crocheted washcloths.

My disgust with Buffalo and disinterest in sports, save for a brief infatuation with the 2005-06 Buffalo Sabres, unsurprisingly came with me to college. I only went to Syracuse's homecoming football game freshman year because I wanted friends, and when a dorm floormate from New Jersey told me he loved ""all Buffalo sports,"" I said he had to be lying. But I soon learned there's a lot to love about a perpetually stumbling football team in a city past its prime. I just had to learn to defend them first.

When it comes to the Bills, there's a reason why pop punk singer Dan Campbell made his uber-depressed persona ""Aaron West"" a Bills fan. The team might be on a roll right now, but it has the dual distinction of holding the record for most consecutive division championship wins and Super Bowl losses. Its 18-season playoff drought required a tenuous string of wins and a chicken-wing bribe to break. And its best players have an uncanny knack for ending up in jail.

This dismal track record essentially means no one chooses to love the Bills; it's a maniacal fandom you're born into. Western New Yorkers and ex-pats usually have their kids crushing Fisher Price tables before they can walk because it's the only way to numb the pain of an inevitable AFC East ranking somewhere below the Patriots. My parents were born in nearby Niagara Falls before the Bills even existed, so fandom was essentially a birthright. But after a dozen too many heartbreaks, even their collection of Bills T-shirts became dust rags.

My flirtation with Bills fandom began when my mom was trying to get rid of a vintage sweatshirt celebrating one of the Bills' 1990-something AFC Championship wins. Freshly returned home for Christmas my freshman year, cold, and in the middle of a thrift-store phase, I pulled the hoodie out of a garbage bag headed for the Salvation Army and then didn't take it off. The Bills finished that 2014 season with a not entirely terrible 9-7 record, and I finished it by actually watching the last game of the year in my newfound favorite sweatshirt.

Then I headed back to Syracuse where, despite being just a few hours' drive from Buffalo, I didn't come across many western New Yorkers. There were, however, plenty of Long Islanders who were happy to redefine ""upstate"" and tell me that ""anything north of Westchester is bumblef--- nowhere."" I was happy to remind them that their just-as-terrible teams were actually from New Jersey, and that it's actually possible to buy a home before you're 50 in bumblef--- nowhere. My Bills allegiance was born.

Sophomore year eventually came around, and so did another Bills season. And at the end of this one, I wasn't just wearing my favorite grey sweatshirt. I had piled Under Armour below it and my heaviest winter jacket on top and headed off to break Orchard Park's open container laws at my first Bills game. There was no hope for a postseason at that point, but you wouldn't know it from the rows and rows of trailers and open car trunks piled into the Erie Community College parking lot next to the stadium.

That first game was filled with practical lessons. Don't dip your non-waterproof gloves in slushy puddles to pick up beanbags that skidded off cornhole boards. Bring your own toilet paper to the port-a-potty. And don't underestimate how good a late-season win against the New Jersey Jets can feel, especially when it blocks them from the playoffs.

The following 2016 season left a lot to be desired of the Bills, but it didn't matter. I paired my sweatshirt with a newly acquired pair of Zubaz every Sunday, livestreamed the game from my job at Syracuse's student newspaper, and mentioned some players' names so the sports reporters nearby wouldn't think I was the one and only Bills bandwagoner in existence. And the following year, I returned home for Christmas knowing that the Bills actually had a chance to make the postseason. When running down Buffalo's Allen Street in the 10-below chill after a 3 a.m. poutine run, I didn't miss a beat when someone yelled the call-and-response piece of Buffalo's adopted ""Shout!"" anthem.

A nap and a drive to Syracuse with a squad of Buffalo fans later, and my friends and I were watching the first of two games that would push the Bills to the postseason for the first time in nearly two decades. First the Bills beat the Miami Dolphins, and then the Cincinnati Bengals finished off the Baltimore Ravens to knock them out of wild card contention, and then we ran outside to party on icy streets.

That was nearly two years ago, before then-rookie quarterback Josh Allen got a chance to get our hopes up once or twice during 2018's dismal season and has already led the Bills to a successful 2019 start. It was also before I moved to New York City, where I'm always ready to remind so-called New Yorkers that the only real New York team is far beyond the Metro North's end."	-15.18

"First COVID-19 came for The Bachelor franchise. Then it postponed Real Housewives and forced a reimagining of the daily talk show. But let the history books show that, try as it might, the pandemic failed to defeat a human instinct so natural that we are already experts at it by age 5: our need to spread and consume gossip.

Netflix has been an unsung hero of the last five months, creating one of the pandemic's first pieces of cultural bedrock and filling up our queues with a healthy supply of mindless, guilty pleasure television. But the streaming giant's most enticing pandemic Cinderella story comes from a group of ostentatious realtors who are finally cashing in on what viewers want to buy.

Selling Sunset, a deliciously Bravo-esque slice of reality television, follows the employees at the Oppenheim Group, a high-end real estate brokerage firm in Los Angeles, as they try to balance the opulent and volatile housing market alongside their opulent and volatile personal lives. The show failed to make a sizable splash after premiering on Netflix in March 2019, garnering minimal critical attention save for some lukewarm reviews. But when it returned to streaming in May 2020 with its sophomore season, the show was released upon a cooped-up, drama-deprived populous. Netflix clearly read the room, announcing in May it would ""surprise"" drop season three just two and a half months later. The world was parched for tea, and Selling Sunset's cup overfloweth.

Led by soap actress Chrishell Stause and the villainous Christine Quinn, Selling Sunset's cast follow the reality TV blueprint of being glossy, gorgeous, and gossipy. Their conversations aren't groundbreaking nor are their fights ruinous, but as VICE points out, pandemic-era gossip doesn't need to be. There's no better time than now to lower our storytelling standards, and reality television was already considered the bottom of the barrel for quality programming. The genre is predicated on over-the-top theatrics, but Selling Sunset's strengths don't lie in its absurdity (although, to be clear, it is often absurd). The show meets the moment because it reminds us how blissful it feels to care about petty, innocuous drama.

""Gossiping is innately human; we're never going to stop,"" entertainment journalist Elaine Lui told The Cut in a May article. ""It's human to want to communicate and to tell stories to each other, and share stories with each other.""

""Telling stories"" to each other would be a generous interpretation of what happens on Selling Sunset, but it wouldn't be entirely wrong. Watching Quinn call Mary Fitzgerald a ""f--king idiot"" at a real estate showing and witnessing the insult slowly make its way back to Fitzgerald is a form of restorative entertainment, a tonic disguised in a tattle-tale.

Gossiping and those who do it are often ridiculed, but as The Atlantic divulged in 2018, it can actually be a legitimately healthy form of socialization. In some ways, gossiping can ""even make us better people,"" facilitating in ""promoting cooperation, boosting others' self-esteem, and performing the essential task of the human family,"" writes Ben Healy. I won't pretend Selling Sunset turned me into Mother Teresa, but watching it did bring me joy, giving me that sweet release of serotonin that's been irregular since February.

I'm clearly not alone. Other writers have described pandemic reality television as a valuable coping mechanism, while others go so far as to say we need it ""now more than ever."" Since Selling Sunset returned in May, interest in the show's drama (and the real-life characters that drive it) has surged. The show's gains in popularity are evident in Google Trends data, which show a significant spike following the second season's release — nearly triple that of its interest following the series premiere in 2019.

Even This is Us actor Justin Hartley, who never directly appears on Selling Sunset but whose marriage to Stause serves as a narrative focal point of the third season, reached a new Google Trends peak immediately following season two, only to trend even higher after season three's release. Data for the third season, which debuted last week, is incomplete — but current buzz indicates yet another high point.

Stause, Quinn, and the rest of the women reaped massive social media benefits from Selling Sunset's summer surge, doubling their Instagram followings (and priming them for lucrative careers as influencers, should they so choose). Viewers may come for the gaudy real-estate porn, but they stay to watch the characters dish the dirt both on and off screen.

Like all reality television, there's a natural inclination to wonder How much of this is scripted? It's a fair ask, one that Quinn has acknowledged vaguely, although there's only so much to be blamed on a production team. Davina Potratz's $75 million house is still on the market, Hartley did file for divorce from Stause, and Quinn did actually dole out botox shots at an open house. As long as the show has a few facts, it's much easier to sell the accompanying fiction.

Selling Sunset doesn't just provide a nice distraction from our problems, though. Sure, part of its appeal is that it takes us out of our current hellscape, but it also reminds us what it feels like to sweat the small stuff. The days of eavesdropping on public transit are over. Snooping by the workplace water cooler has been put on hold. By allowing the bombastic drama to build and marinate, the show reminds viewers they can care about the little things even amidst an unrelenting heaviness.

By no means should Selling Sunset be considered great pandemic art, but it might just be the pandemic's best cultural remedy. As Quinn says in the final moments of season three's opener, ""I never start the drama, I just finish it."" And oh, is it a thrill to sit back, relax, and watch her close the deal."	-15.18
"It's been over 10 months since Madonna questionably called COVID-19 ""the great equalizer,"" and her words continue to age like milk.

Nearly 20 million people in the U.S. have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine and 3.5 million have been fully vaccinated, with healthcare personnel, older adults, and other essential workers among the prioritized groups. But in some cases, all it takes is a little monetary gift to move to the top of the queue.

Overlake Medical Center & Clinics, a hospital outside of Seattle, Washington, found itself with 500 open vaccine slots — and it chose to send emails to its ""major"" donors offering the jab, The Seattle Times reports. The ""by invite"" only emails were reportedly sent to those who had given more than $10,000 to the hospital system, and they offered up slots during the last week of January.

Overlake decided to ""cut access to the exclusive appointments"" following a call from the office of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) Tuesday morning. Inslee later said the prioritization of a ""VIP list"" for vaccine appointments is ""not acceptable for us,"" adding that ""we've got to maintain public credibility in the system.""

The appointments were not solely offered to the list of over 100 donors, Overlake said, but were also presented to board members, patients, volunteers, employees, and retired health providers, per The Seattle Times. The medical center's chief operating officer Tom DeBord told The Times ""In hindsight, we could certainly look back and say this wasn't the best way to do it.""

The snafu at Overlake isn't an isolated event. Vaccine ""fast-passes"" have been distributed to members of the donor class in Florida, while wealthy non-donors have pestered doctors over whether a donation would boost their priority in the queue. The optics of the Overlake situation only add more fuel to the fire regarding the vaccine's velvet rope. Marianne Dodson"	-15.18
"The biggest disappointment of CODA, one of the opening-day films of this year's Sundance Film Festival, is that it wasn't able to receive its deserved standing ovation in Park City's Eccles Theater. By virtue of this year's nearly all-virtual festival, the most significant reactions to the film were in the privacy of attendee's assorted homes: chuckles and belly-laughs on apartment couches, and — at least on my end — the kind of waterworks that would have mortified me in a crowd.

But the fractured nature of this year's film festival shouldn't temper the celebration of CODA, which in all likelihood will be not just one of the best movies at Sundance, but of the year.

The title's acronym, which stands for ""Child Of Deaf Adults,"" describes Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high school senior who divides her time between serving as an interpreter for her family, working on her father's fishing boat, and pursuing her love of singing. Juggling all three, though, is an impossible task, and Ruby has to sort through her complicated sense of familial obligation and the independence she feels she owes herself. Writer/director Siân Heder shot the movie entirely in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 2019 — the same rough locale as another major Sundance hit, 2016's Manchester By the Sea. But there is no soggy melancholy in Heder's script, which is luminously funny, although it will have you in tears by its final scene.

Both Heder and Jones learned sign language for the film, while CODA's deaf characters are played by deaf actors Marlee Matlin (the Oscar-winning actress of Children of a Lesser God, who plays Ruby's mother), Daniel Durant (Ruby's older brother Leo), and Troy Kotsur (Ruby's father). Jones' performance is award-worthy, but some of the best scenes belong to her co-stars, including an awkward and hilariously graphic sex talk by Ruby's well-meaning father.

Critics are already describing CODA as a ""crowd-pleaser,"" even if there was never an assembled crowd to actually see it. But the term perhaps downplays how special the film is, too. Matlin personally championed the film to the point of what she describes as obsession, praising CODA to The Los Angeles Times as an authentic depiction of deaf people in normal, day-to-day life.

But CODA isn't just authentic with its subjects in terms of their disability — it's authentic with the treatment of their emotions, too. By the movie's end, you fully understand: The last word in the script isn't the spoken ""go,"" urging someone away. It's the signed I love you, holding them close. Jeva Lange"	-15.18
"For a brief moment on Tuesday night, it looked like there might be a cascade of Republicans abandoning President Trump and moving toward cooperating with Democrats on his impeachment, conviction, and ban from future office for his role in the sacking of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The New York Times reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ""privately"" believes the president committed impeachable offenses and that the process could help ""make it easier to purge Mr. Trump from the party."" Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking Republican in the House, announced her intention, in a blistering statement, to support Trump's removal from the office, along with a handful of moderates including Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and Rep. Jamie Herrera-Butler (R-Wash.)

But by Wednesday morning, it was clear: With maybe a few more defectors, that was going to be the extent of the Republican rebuke of Trump in the House. Just 10 out of more than 200 GOP members of Congress ended up voting yes on impeachment, or less than 5 percent of the House's Republican caucus. Even if McConnell refuses to whip votes for acquittal in the Senate or even votes to convict, it's not clear that he can produce another 16 Republican to get to the constitutionally required two-thirds majority. For now, the relationship of most Republicans to President Trump looks unchanged. If there is a groundswell to ""purge"" the president from the GOP, it has yet to materialize.

The shameful refusal of elected Republicans to put country over party is now part of a long and well-established pattern. Throughout Trump's first campaign and then his ignominious term in office, nearly every Republican has decided, again and again, that their short-term political interests are better served by standing by Trump, no matter the scale of the crime or the undeniability of the outrage. Brows were furrowed, but eventually unfurrowed after a sober assessment of the political landscape.

Whether it was the Access Hollywood scandal, ""very fine"" Nazis in Charlottesville, the countless obstructions of justice, the daily self-enrichment at the expense of taxpayers, and the extortion of an ally for political gain, there has always been a moment where it looked like his support was crumbling, only for his transactional alliances with GOP elites to congeal once again into a gelatinous mold of hyper-partisan mutual interest. The only elected Republicans to truly break from Trump generally did so while announcing their retirements, including former senators Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) or their departure from the party, like Rep. Justin Amash, now an independent.

The president's Twitter bullhorn was deployed relentlessly to hound and expel defectors, who found themselves ostracized within the party and loathed by their own constituents. His staunchest apologists concocted absurd counter-narratives whose essential preposterousness gradually faded into a hazy conventional wisdom for rank-and-file Republicans. Particularly after his first few months in office, his support among ordinary Republicans never collapsed. Even today, he is more popular than he was during the failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act in 2017. A recent Quinnipiac poll put his approval rating at 33 percent overall, but still 71 percent among self-identified Republicans. Those just aren't quite jump-ship numbers for people who have staked their legacies on the president.

And so far, the idea of letting Trump ""fade away"" like a bad hangover has far more support in the GOP caucus than either impeachment in the House or conviction in the Senate. Wednesday's floor speeches from House Republicans opposing impeachment carried all the hallmarks of the Trump era — a combination of absurd calls for unity (""Let's look forward rather than backward""), bad-faith complaints about process (""This process was rushed!""), artless dodges (""The president didn't literally tell his minions to sack the Capitol, thus he is not culpable"") and hostage-taking (""If you do this, it will make his violent supporters angrier"").

Why are most elected Republicans still terrified of President Trump's wrath, even though he'll be out of office in seven days? Many, particularly in the House, fear a threatened primary challenge in 2022 from MAGA candidates seeking vengeance against any Republican who betrays the president. Even members in safe GOP districts would prefer to avoid the hassle of a serious primary challenge, and all of the attendant harassment and threats to physical safety that come with standing up to the ascendant forces of white nationalism in the party. After all, with most members of the House representing landslide districts, the average Republican fears the GOP primary electorate far more than anything else.

Given these realities, what seems more likely? A preponderance of elected Republicans joining Kinzinger and Herrera-Butler in this too-little, too-late move against President Trump? Or people like Liz Cheney getting deposed from their leadership positions, McConnell ultimately backing away from a Senate conviction, and the Trumpian takeover of the party proceeding apace? Unfortunately for the future of American democracy, the Cheney wing looks outnumbered and unlikely to win a GOP civil war unless voters themselves turn on Trumpism.

Still, some caveats are in order. If the last five years have taught us anything, it's that we should not be terribly confident in our predictions about the near-term political future. Perhaps McConnell, in the coming days, will make an affirmative effort to round up votes for conviction. While Republican senators may fear the long-term threat from Trump, the more immediate danger of falling out of favor with the minority leader could carry the day.

And while it is impossible to know what exactly is going on in McConnell's brain, he might ultimately calculate that producing enough votes to toss Trump overboard could play successfully into the public's bottomless appetite for bipartisanship and short-circuit any momentum for Democratic procedural escalation, like eliminating the Senate's filibuster rule. If convicting President Trump can produce the necessary gridlock in Congress to destroy President-elect Joe Biden's term in office and deliver power back to the GOP in 2022, he might do it.

Ongoing revelations could also play a significant role in the Senate. Last night, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) alleged that GOP members of Congress had given the insurrectionists ""reconnaissance tours"" of the Capitol building in the days before the mob's deadly siege. Far-right activist Ali Alexander now claims that he was working directly with three Republican members of Congress, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar of Arizona and Mo Brooks of Alabama, in plotting the attack. Despite explicit instructions to stay off of social media during the siege, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert (Colo.), truly one of the craziest people ever to hold elected office in the United States, tweeted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had left the floor, helpfully narrowing the range of locations for insurrectionists who were hunting the Democratic party leader.

While we should be careful not to jump to any firm conclusions yet, it seems within the realm of possibility that insurrectionists planning to murder sitting members of Congress received assistance from inside the GOP caucus. Meanwhile, President Trump was cheering on the mob even as it infiltrated the Capitol, with some clearly intent on assassinating Vice President Pence. If operational links are established between the Trump White House, potential co-conspirators in Congress, and the insurrectionists themselves, the guess here is that this will be too much for all but the most hardened dead-enders to tolerate.

We're still a long way from proving any such thing, however, and therefore the safe assumption continues to be that President Trump will both finish out his term and narrowly avoid a conviction in any trial."	-15.18
"OK, boomers: You have one last chance not to leave the country in terrible shape.

The inauguration of President Biden on Wednesday probably is the last great political triumph of the Baby Boom generation. Technically, Biden isn't a boomer — he was born in 1942, a few years before the end of World War II — but he does belong to the boomer and boomer-adjacent cohort of American politicians who came of political age in the 1970s and '80s. They were shaped by Vietnam, Watergate, and Reaganism, and they first took the White House with the election of 46-year-old Bill Clinton in 1992.

Clinton had it easy. He took the reins of power from President George H.W. Bush, who was the last of a generation of presidents who served the country during World War II. The Cold War had just come to an end, so Clinton didn't need to promise to make America great — he arrived in office as the country was at the zenith of its power and prestige.

Biden has a much more difficult challenge.

America is mired in a once-in-a-century pandemic that has already killed 400,000 people. The country is experiencing its second economic calamity in a dozen years. And our democracy is fragile enough that when commentators speak of the possibility of civil war, it doesn't seem all that shrill or hyperbolic. The last time a majority of Americans felt satisfied with the direction of the United States was January 2004 — after the invasion of Iraq, but when it was still plausible to many of us that the U.S. could win the war. The most recent Gallup poll, in December, showed that just 16 percent of Americans are bullish on their country.

So Biden has two jobs, really. The first is to stop the bleeding. The second is to prepare, at long last, to hand the reins of leadership to a younger generation.

Both tasks require figuring out how we got here. The devolution of the country from triumphant to barely holding it together came as the Clinton-Biden generation of politicians gradually aged from fresh-faced 40-somethings who hung out with the cool kids on MTV to a group of gerontocrats hanging onto power. Donald Trump, who just left office, is 74. Biden is 78. So is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is 80. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is 70. Vice President Kamala Harris and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) are both relatively young — they are in their 50s — but McCarthy, at least, seems to have a shaky hold on power these days.

It may be unfair and ageist to pin America's problems on the fact that so much of our leadership class is eligible for Social Security. But it does seem that the generation of leaders born in the 1940s and '50s have squandered their inheritance. Clinton had an affair in the Oval Office, which helped chisel away at the notion that character matters in leadership. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) pioneered the practice of politics as a permanent culture war that can sometimes spill over into real violence. President George W. Bush launched the war in Iraq, failed New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, and then left the country in economic ruin. Trump's sins have been documented ad nauseum. All the while, leaders on both sides of the aisle helped kick the can down the road on existential issues like climate change, ignored warning signs of growing economic inequality, and (at best) slow-walked progress on racial inequality until that situation became untenable.

Is it any wonder that ""OK, boomer"" has become the to-go insult for exhausted and embittered millennials?

Those young voters shouldn't get too cocky, though. The boomers they disdain were once optimistic young people who thought they would save the world from their out-of-touch elders, too. And millennials will need Biden to be successful just to have a chance to show they can do a better job once given the chance.

The new president and his Democratic allies who now control Congress seem determined to try to set things right by making advances on climate change, racism, and economic inequality. But they will need to do a better job of cultivating a younger group of successors. Biden has started that task by selecting Harris as his vice president. But the leadership of House Democrats is increasingly under fire for being ""old and out of touch,"" and Senate Democrats aren't much better. If Democrats aren't ready to hand over leadership to a new generation by the time the 2022 and 2024 elections arrive, they will have failed.

Then again, maybe younger leaders won't keep waiting around for their elders to make way. On Wednesday, much of the nation was wowed by the inauguration poetry of 22-year-old Amanda Gorman, a young woman who is already making plans. ""This is a long, long, faraway goal, but 2036 I am running for office to be president of the United States,"" she told The New York Times in 2017, when she was just 19. ""So you can put that in your iCloud calendar."" If Biden does his job right, America will still be a country worth leading by then."	-15.18
"America's immigration system was broken even before President Donald Trump's white nationalist aide Stephen Miller took his hammer to it.

It is hard to remember, but four short years before Trump assumed office, the national conversation was focused on rolling back the red tape and bureaucratic obstacles that were preventing too many worthy immigrants from coming into the country. Yet far from deregulating the system, as would have behooved an administration allegedly dedicated to cutting bureaucracy, Trump, with Miller's help, systematically exploited every flaw in every part of the system to radically cut back immigration beyond anything anyone outside of ultra-restrictionist circles had ever imagined.

So President-elect Joe Biden will have to rebuild it brick-by-brick on a priority basis. But while he is doing so, he should also work with Congress to add layers of support to protect it from assaults by future Stephen Millers.

For the last four years, the headlines focused on the administration's more sensational anti-immigration initiatives including the ""Muslim"" travel ban; scrapping the DACA program that gave deportation relief to those who were brought to the United States without authorization as children; the Great Wall of Trump; a zero-tolerance border policy that ended up snatching babies from migrant moms seeking asylum and viciously separating families. In addition, the Migration Policy Institute has identified more than 400-plus behind-the-scenes executive actions and rule changes that have received less attention but have been even more effective in walling out immigrants.

Consider immigrant visas for the overseas family members — spouses, minor children, parents and siblings — of American citizens and permanent residents. Even before the pandemic, Cato Institute's David Bier calculated that immigration under this category had declined by about 24 percent compared to 2016 because the administration slowed processing and doubled the denial rate. But things came to a near complete halt during the pandemic. In May, the administration allowed a measly 782 immigrants in this category compared to the monthly average of 55,000 four years ago. How did Miller accomplish this feat? He used the pretext of the pandemic to shut down consular offices so that they could no longer conduct the mandatory in-person interviews. However, he did not allow them to switch to online interviews, putting applicants in a complete bind. All in all, under this administration, about 738,000 fewer overseas family members of Americans will be admitted into the country — the other family separation policy that no one talks about.

But it's not just foreigners abroad whom Miller has thwarted. He also made it infinitely more difficult for foreign professionals and others already in the U.S. to upgrade temporary visas to green cards or permanent resident status. Compared to 2016, the Trump administration is approving less than half of their applications and by January, if the current rate persists, about 246,313 fewer such applicants will be able to get green cards.

It took Miller a few years to implement his diabolical plans to slam these two categories of immigrants. Not so with respect to refugees. Right off the bat he slashed the annual refugee cap from 110,000 under Obama to 15,000 now, a historic low. And he subjected them to such ""extreme vetting"" that the U.S. isn't even going to hit that ceiling. All in all, during Trump's tenure, America will end up admitting nearly 300,000 fewer refugees than if 2016 levels had been maintained.

Refugees of course settle permanently in the U.S. as do others seeking green cards. But Miller hasn't even spared tourists and business travelers who want to just visit America for a short time. Bier estimates that the Trump administration has issued nine million fewer visas than would have been the case had it maintained the 2016 rate. Some of this drop can be attributed to coronavirus-related travel restrictions, but much of it happened before that.

The upshot is that the backlog of applications for any kind of immigration benefit — green cards, temporary work visas, tourist visas, you name it — has skyrocketed. Before Trump assumed office, this backlog was two times the quarterly number of new applications, which was shameful enough. But now this backlog has almost doubled. Currently, seven million people wishing to come to the U.S. for any reason are cooling their heels.

America's immigration system is restrictive but it is not this restrictive. Congress has created all these programs to give immigrants functioning pathways to come to the country. But Miller and Trump have jammed literally all of them. Moreover, Bier and his Cato colleague Alex Nowrasteh point out, Miller's actions have contradicted every principle that Congress has enshrined in immigration law including family reunification, equal treatment by nationality, and humanitarian relief for those escaping persecution or political turmoil.

How did he accomplish this? Essentially by abusing grants of executive power in immigration law when he could. And when he couldn't, he grabbed these powers from other laws.

Consider how Trump's travel ban against mostly Muslim countries used one immigration law to subvert another. The Immigration Act of 1965 was expressly meant to end four decades of discriminatory national origins quotas that gave preference to white European immigrants over brown-skinned Asians and extend equal treatment to all. But the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act also grants a president the authority to ""suspend entry of aliens or a class of aliens"" that he deems detrimental to ""national interest."" This has typically been used to bar agents of a hostile power or hardened criminals — not impose a religious or national test. But Trump's travel ban invoked this authority to do exactly that.

When Trump couldn't turn immigration law against itself, he used other statutes to do so. For example, note Bier and Nowrasteh, when the pandemic hit, Miller prevailed on Trump to use the emergency powers he had invoked to suspend the family reunification program for the entire year. Moreover, he went out of his way to emphasize that he was doing so not to protect American health but American jobs. Basically, he was thumbing his nose at Congress that has explicitly and repeatedly rejected a labor market test for this program because it is too cruel to keep husbands and wives or parents and children separated. There are numerous other examples of similar power grabs by Miller to advance his restrictionist agenda.

The most urgent question now, with Trump and Miller on their way out, is what should Congress do to ensure that its will is respected in the future?

Bier and Nowrasteh recommend enacting a strict two-week limit on a president's ability to impose a travel ban, especially one based on nationality and religion. Any extension should require Congressional authorization, which ought to be granted only if the president can prove that there is some compelling — not just ordinary — national interest at stake.

In addition, I would suggest, instead of handing the president the authority to establish a ceiling for refugee admission, Congress should set a floor every year. If an administration is unable to hit the mandatory minimum quota, it should be required to offer an explanation. Moreover, right now immigrants whose visa petitions are denied have no recourse, regardless of whether they are sponsored by their families or employers. They are completely at the mercy of the federal bureaucracy. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Calif.) has suggested offering some judicial recourse by creating a visa appeals board that can review the grounds of their rejection.

None of this is perfect. Congress has built executive discretion in immigration laws to allow the president to respond to emerging circumstances on the ground. And Trump is far from the first president to use that discretion not to welcome but to stop immigrants.

But Miller was unusually diabolical and motivated and took things to a whole new level. He had a keen understanding of the loopholes in America's immigration system and knew exactly how to exploit them in the service of an ultra-restrictionist agenda. His actions were effectively a stress test of the system and exposed its weaknesses. Biden should use that information to work with Congress to foolproof it against future Millers."	-15.18
"If there were ever a year to shop small for Christmas, 2020 is it.

This year has been unprecedented, chaotic, and frightening for Americans in a lot of ways. But since March, the year's upheavals have had a severe impact on small businesses.

A survey of nearly 6,000 small businesses between March and April of this year found that only weeks into the pandemic, massive layoffs and closures had already occurred. Many businesses were financially fragile, and expected their hardships to continue throughout the year. While several small businesses recovered somewhat during the summer, according to the National Small Business Association, only one-third were ""very confident"" they'd be able to recover from the pandemic and economic downturn; 99 percent of respondents said they were ""very"" or ""somewhat"" worried about their ability to survive.

Now, as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations increase across the country, leading many states to crack down again on business and social gatherings, there's a chance that small businesses could face another huge hit, both before and during the Christmas season.

American's consumerism most often leads to a glut of spending after Thanksgiving. People line up outside Targets and shopping malls, hoping to score a new television or appliance. Often, fights over Black Friday deals break out in stores across the country. (So much for Christmas spirit and generosity.) I rather hope COVID-19 guidelines and precautions prevent Americans from indulging in the worst of their avaricious spending sprees this year. Of all the things to risk crowding in place for, a new smartphone may be the worst. Please don't risk your health — and the health of your community — for some fancy new gadget or cheap Christmas deal.

But there's a chance we could do more than merely avoid our worst shopping vices. Perhaps this year, we could trade in our usual consumptive habits for more meaningful shopping traditions, and thus add some value to one of the more dubious habits of the American holiday season.

There are a handful of companies that can and will benefit hugely from the stresses and anxieties of this season in American life. Amazon, in particular, has experienced explosive growth this year, even though (as The Verge reported earlier this year) it does so by ""continuously push[ing] workers to the point of harm in the name of efficiency."" Amazon's impact on our shopping habits, as well as on the wellbeing of its workers, should give us pause before we wholeheartedly embrace their Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals.

True, there are few safer options for the average American consumer than to purchase everything from the comfort of one's couch. It would be easy for us, struggling with fear, mental stress, or other anxieties of this strange season, to turn to the most efficient means of holiday shopping — whether through Amazon or other behemoth online retailers.

But businesses with fewer than 500 employees are responsible for nearly half of American jobs, and 43.5 percent of our GDP, according to Harvard Business Review. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance reports that independent, locally-owned businesses are credited with fostering higher incomes and fighting income inequality, fueling job creation, generating more tax revenue, improving environmental sustainability, fostering community health and cohesion, and more. Buying local isn't just a sentimental move; it has a marked impact on the places where we live.

And the places we live have suffered this year. People have died, lost jobs, feared over the sicknesses of their loved ones, and struggled to put food on the table. Many have faced mental health struggles, as well as societal and familial pressures. Many of our elderly have suffered and died alone. This year, perhaps more than any other, we can demonstrate both our solidarity and our care for our communities.

That should transcend how we shop, and characterize the way we give, as well. Many local ministries — food banks, soup kitchens, clothing donation centers, homeless shelters, nursing homes — are gearing up for the cold winter months, and will need both donations and volunteers. There's a chance that, rather than spending all our extra time shopping online, we could develop the rather subversive habit of using our free holiday time to bless the needy in our community.

But even the simple act of shopping can be impactful, when it is employed to bless our neighbors — and buying local this year needn't be an arduous or dangerous endeavor. Many of my favorite local stores are working hard to keep their employees and customers safe during the pandemic. Continuing to buy local will help these small businesses survive the worst of this winter, and hopefully empower them to survive whatever 2021 might hold (my hope is for normalcy, but there's no telling at this point).

Shopping small this year could involve buying books from local or online indie bookstores, shopping at a local plant nursery or hardware store instead of going to Home Depot, or buying gift cards to locally-owned wineries, breweries, and restaurants. It could involve looking for presents on Etsy or seeking out other small online shops and businesses, getting honey or candles from a local apiary, frequenting locally-owned gift shops or clothing stores, or seeking out a fun thrift shop or antique store find. In the past, I've bought my parents gift cards to the local theater or tickets to a Shakespeare play (many ballet companies and local theaters are still offering fun online deals and showings).

It would be easy this year to allow our shopping to become a highly detached and impersonal event. But if there's one thing 2020 has taught me, it's that our actions can have a far-reaching communal impact. We've all been challenged to work a little harder this year to take care of the people around us — whether it's by wearing a mask and social distancing, or by hunkering down at home for long periods of time. This year has reminded us that we can worry primarily about our own wellbeing, freedoms, and comfort — or we can put forth a little effort to also bless our neighbors, steward our community, and look out for those less fortunate. It feels funny, perhaps, suggesting that our shopping habits could be part of the latter effort, rather than the former. But this year, in particular, it's true.

Who knows? Maybe this year will be an opportunity for us to engrain new habits of giving that we will continue to foster in future decades. But regardless, I hope this holiday season will prompt us to shop and give differently, so that we can serve our neighbors in a deeply tangible way. Honestly, that sounds far better than scoring a huge deal on a new Amazon Echo."	-15.18
"When COVID-19 started exploding back in March, the Dow Jones Industrial Average often tumbled by a thousand or even two thousand points a day. So how did the stock market react this week to another extreme crisis — the most destructive breach of the U.S. Capitol since the War of 1812 and what could be seen as a possible coup attempt? It reacted pretty well. The Dow dipped for a bit during the worst of the Jan. 6 attack, but finished higher on the day. And it rose the next day, too. Stocks also finished positive today, despite a disappointing December jobs report.

To some populist critics on the left and right, this sanguine financial behavior will be interpreted as more evidence of a worrisome disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street. Obviously, the big banks and hedge funds could care less about a historic assault on American democracy, as well as the continuing economic pain being suffered by a pandemic-ravaged nation. ""Late capitalism"" at its very worst.

But just the opposite, I think: Wall Street's confidence reflects a big bet on a brighter American future, certainly in the near to medium term. Disagree with that assessment if you want, but that's how investors are seeing things. Here's what JPMorgan told clients in its morning note, the day after the chaos on Capitol Hill: ""Whether you think this is a 'failed insurrection,' 'failed coup,' 'terrorism' or 'just a few bad apples' there is no obvious policy or law enforcement response that impacts markets.""

All of which is correct. Congress still certified the electoral vote victory by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Martial law wasn't declared in the wake of the attack. Markets opened as usual the next morning. Donald Trump will still leave office in less than two weeks. The system is working, even with an unhinged, authoritarian president sitting in the Oval Office.

And now it's time to focus on an American economy that seems headed toward its strongest performance in perhaps four decades. Democratic victories in the two Georgia elections for the U.S. Senate have made Wall Street even more bullish about 2021. With Democrats taking unified control in Washington, investors are expecting more fiscal stimulus beyond the $900 billion plan passed in late December.

And while today's job report was disappointing — the U.S. shed 140,000 jobs last month rather than an expected gain of 50,000 — the continuing vaccine roll-out should eventually help unleash huge demand in hard-hit sectors such as travel and restaurants. Of course, that assumes the pace of vaccinations picks up considerably. Goldman Sachs, for instance, expects about half the U.S. population will be vaccinated by April, climbing to about three-fourths by year-end. So some potential there for disappointment that would delay the return to strong economic growth.

But there are longer-term risks, ones that stem directly from the failed revolt. High-trust societies — trust in public institutions, businesses, and fellow citizens — tend to be fast-growing societies. As Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said on the Senate floor Wednesday night, ""You can't do big things together as Americans if you think other Americans are the enemy."" It's doubtful American trust in much of anything has improved over the past week.

Moreover, a sizable chunk of America's global influence comes from the powerful example of its success as a smooth-functioning — albeit imperfect — multiracial democracy, as well as from its direct military and economic power. As it is, America's pandemic response has worsened a decline in our global image caused by the 2016 election of President Trump. Events on Wednesday surely eroded that image and influence further.

For instance: Soon after the attack on Congress, Zimbabwe's president tweeted that the United States had no right to extend economic sanctions: ""Yesterday's events showed that the U.S. has no moral right to punish another nation under the guise of upholding democracy. These sanctions must end."" And the front-page headline in Keyna's biggest independent newspaper: ""Who's the banana republic now?"" America has suffered a long-lasting national humiliation on the global stage just as competition with China for international influence intensifies.

Or think about a bit of billionaire news you may have missed this week. Elon Musk surpassed Jeff Bezos as the world's richest man. Musk, a South African-born immigrant who has been a U.S. citizen since 2002, has long praised America as the best place to live if you want to make big dreams come true. After four years of the Trump administration's persistence in undermining the U.S. immigration system and now a frightening attack on the center of U.S. democracy by terrorists that included white supremacists, how inviting does America look right now to foreigners with big dreams?

I'm not sure how you factor any of this into an economic forecasting model. And maybe an economically resurgent and politically resilient America will come to overshadow memories of the violent penetration, desecration, and sack of the U.S. Capitol. Long-term American prosperity may depend on it."	-15.18
"When your industry gets a lower approval rating than both President Trump and Congress, it might be a sign that it has gone astray with the American public. When it gets a lower rating than Congress', it's practically confirmation. Gallup's findings last week did just that, putting the disconnect between the tenor of the national media's coverage of Trump in the coronavirus crisis and Americans' approval of him in stark relief.

The Gallup poll asked specifically about the response of various institutions to the pandemic, not overall performance approval, in the third week of March. Hospitals, schools, employers, state governments, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health all scored in the 80 percent range. Roughly 20 points below that came Vice President Mike Pence, Trump, and Congress, right around the 60 percent mark and in that order. All of the aforementioned had solidly positive ratings by 20 or more points — even Congress, an institution whose overall approval rating usually registers in the teens, if not single digits.

The only American institution to register in negative numbers for its coronavirus response was the national media. Between March 13 and 22, only 44 percent of respondents rated the national media's performance in the crisis positively. More than half — 55 percent — expressed disapproval over the media's performance. The partisan split on this question was significant: Sixty-one percent of Democrats felt positively about the media's response, while just 25 percent of Republicans approved of it.

The media’s negative ratings from a public are even more remarkable, coming from Americans clearly in the mood to support its national institutions in this crisis. The media's focus on itself and its existing antagonisms with Trump rather than on the urgent issues at has created a further gulf between the industry and its consumers. They failed to grasp the moment that Trump belatedly recognized, and they still have not quite come to terms with it.

At the time of the survey, Trump had only just started to change his public messaging on COVID-19. He had previously chosen to minimize the potential effects of the pandemic and his approval rating sagged even further than normal as a result. The White House then shifted its messaging to focus on the crisis as a ""war,"" and Trump (mostly) dropped the minimizing rhetoric to speak in more stark terms about the virus.

To some extent, Trump's polling surge is at least in part a rally effect. In a crisis, voters instinctively want and need leaders to react well. However, actions taken by Trump shortly after his substantial pivot has contributed to that impulse and will matter to the endurance of his polling surge. His leadership on the historic $2.2 trillion relief bill helped bridge a partisan divide when negotiations broke down between Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, and Nancy Pelosi, perhaps mostly by signaling openness to their demands for transparency and accountability on corporate assistance. Trump also made an effort to work with Democratic governors in California and New York, with Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom and Andrew Cuomo offering praise for his efforts — at times, anyway.

Now, Americans seem to like what they're seeing from Trump. Almost every polling series, with the exception of normally friendly Rasmussen, shows Trump getting the best overall approval ratings of his presidency. The RealClearPolitics aggregate hit its highest average approval level, 47.2 percent, higher even than the 45.9 percent just after Trump's inauguration. The latest iteration of The Washington Post/ABC News series not only has Trump at the first positive approval rating of his presidency (48/46), it also shows the incumbent president building an impressive enthusiasm gap among voters for November over former Vice President Joe Biden. Fifty-five percent of Trump's supporters claim to be ""very enthusiastic,"" almost double that among Biden supporters (28 percent).

Perhaps the most successful strategy deployed by the White House to communicate Trump's change of posture has been the daily presidential press conference. Trump has revived the White House press briefing tradition that he had ended due to his preference for communicating through Twitter. The upswing in his approval ratings shows the power of the bully pulpit to shape public opinion, a tool that Trump arguably neglected for too long. The press has not had this kind of daily access to a president in a very long while, perhaps as far back as the 2008-2009 financial crash or even the 2003 Iraq war.

The media's reaction to such access has been instructive. While outlets' ratings have soared, some reporters want their employers to stop covering the briefings, ostensibly because of Trump's proclivity for spreading misinformation, but also perhaps because of the briefings' effectiveness at boosting Trump's popularity; as CNN's Daniel Dale complained, they had ""replace[d] campaign rallies.""

That attitude might puzzle viewers who are locked in their homes and desperate to find out what's happening with the coronavirus crisis. Coming from the same media outlets that have lamented (for good reason) the end of the daily briefings during normal, non-crisis periods, these complaints sound hypocritical. Furthermore, they have a strong whiff of bias, especially when reporters spend too much time trying to interrogate Trump over his past statements rather than on what is happening at the moment.

Voters appear to be signaling that these fights are of little interest to them. Rightly or wrongly, what Americans see is the media feuding with the president while the president takes action to meaningfully address the crisis."	-15.18
"Listen, I get it: Among all the displays of Republican cynicism in the Trump era, Sen. Lindsey Graham's might rank the highest. From the maverick McCain sidekick who supported comprehensive immigration reform and legislation to mitigate climate change, to vigorous Trump critic, to resigned Trump supporter, to enthusiastic Trump enabler, golf partner, and pro-Brett Kavanaugh carnival-barker — it actually got old to wonder whether the outgoing president had compromising information on the South Carolina senator.

You know what's coming next: Graham is going to pretend like Trump never happened, pull his maverick wardrobe out of storage, and make noises about the need for renewed bipartisan comity and grand bargains on debt reduction.

The professional left can't wait to pounce. Not just on the Lindsey Grahams in Congress, but on the entire firmament of institutional support for Donald Trump, from the Rupert Murdoch media empire to the Federalist Society to every elected Republican who turned a blind eye to Trump's corruption and incompetence.

There is at least one person who likely, and wisely, will not pounce — President-elect Joe Biden. This, despite Biden's ""personal disappointment"" in Graham for not immediately recognizing his election victory. Whether or not Biden continues to hold a personal grudge — and who could blame him? — he can't afford to hold a political one.

Biden's strategy throughout 2020 — the Democratic primary, the long hot summer of protest, rioting, looting, and the unprecedented tumult of the transition — has been an extensive exercise in strategic restraint. Call it temperamental rope-a-dope. He knew Trump would not resist the self-defeating urge to make the presidential race about himself. So he sat back and let him. And not for one moment did Biden seem concerned about Trump's efforts to overturn the result. The coolest cucumber in Wilmington, Delaware.

At every turn, Biden's leverage has increased. First it was the majority of Democratic primary voters who, fearing an almost-certain defeat of Bernie Sanders, coalesced behind the candidate who had led Trump in literally every single poll. The eventual failure of progressive-left candidates in contested House districts has left virtually no doubt that Biden was right to run up the middle in the general election. Now, thanks in no small part to Trump's outlandish and perhaps criminal behavior in the weeks since Nov. 3, the Senate has fallen into Democrats' lap.

And that's where Lindsey Graham comes in.

With a 50-50 split in the chamber, in which the vice president can break a partisan deadlock, the Biden administration will have the slimmest of possible margins to confirm appointees and judges and pass meaningful legislation. Moderate senators in both parties will have significant sway.

You can bet that Lindsey Graham will want to be one of those senators.

Democrats should let him. Indeed, they should encourage him (privately, of course).

I have long believed that what happens and what is said in front of the curtain of American politics is more important than what happens behind it. There actually are very few mysteries. As fun as it may be to speculate about Graham's private life, he has himself plausibly explained why he behaves the way he does: He wants to be relevant. He wants to be a player. He is a 65-year-old, unmarried, childless man for whom politics is everything.

Call him shallow, malleable, or soulless if you must. But realize that those same qualities can be an asset to the Biden administration. There is a decent chance that Graham will become the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, which will be chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Graham and Sanders are quickly going to play a key role in the all-important ""reconciliation"" bill that's not subject to the Senate filibuster rule requiring a supermajority of 60 votes.

Whether Democrats like it or not, Graham is going to be a ""player.""

That's why it's critical that Graham not be shot down if, as I suspect, he signals that he is open to cooperation.

Since the shocking and sordid events in the Capitol of last week, Graham has said that ""Enough is enough"" and that it's ""time to heal and move on."" In the immediate term, Graham is trying to save Trump, one last time, from a second House impeachment. But it's imperative for Democrats to explore if he means more by healing and moving on.

As repellent as you might find Graham's ability to shed one persona and adopt another, consider how useful it would be to Biden if Graham switched back to his ""old self"" — the guy who championed the painful but necessary solution to the shambles that is U.S. immigration law, who came closer than you think to pushing cap-and-trade across the finish line during the Obama administration. Looking ahead, Democrats need to view Graham's cynicism and self-interest as a feature, not a flaw. If any long-term good is going to result from the Biden presidency, Sen. Lindsey Graham is going to be part of it.

To make sure that happens, Democrats need to be as transactional as he is.

It's not going to be pleasant.

But I'm here to tell you that it's absolutely necessary."	-15.18
"Earlier this year, when you could do radical things like go outside and be around other people, I went to an auto show. There was a classic car exhibit there with models from the 1920s and '30s, and the thing that struck me was how, despite being undeniably beautiful, these cars also seemed sort of, uh, bad: uncomfortable, clunky, impractical.

Fine, they were early iterations of an emerging technology. But after the upheaval of World War II came the boom of the 1950s and the rise of suburbia and car culture. Cars got better. Automatic transmissions, air conditioning, cruise control all emerged. The sheer necessity of millions needing personal transportation precipitated a reality in which cars radically improved.

Now we're living through what may well be another history-altering period. And as tens of millions of people shelter in place or work from home due to the coronavirus pandemic, they are running up against the fact that, much like those early classic cars, a lot of today's digital tech is, uh, bad: Video calls are confusing and low quality, collaborative work software has hardly changed in years, online shopping is struggling to keep up. Meanwhile the tech itself is often expensive or clunky.

As with cars in the '50s, will the inertia of sudden social change, this time brought on by a pandemic, force technology to get better?

As noted tech analyst Benedict Evans argues, the pandemic and its related effects on how people work and interact is like a giant forced experiment. People who have never participated in a video conference or bought groceries online are now doing these things for the first time, because they have little other choice. But this is often unnecessarily complicated, and already we're seeing signs that users want an easier interface. One reason video call app Zoom has taken off — shockingly, it now has 300 million users compared to 10 million just a few months ago — is that it's better than Microsoft's Skype or Cisco's WebEx. You simply pass around a link and voila, you're in.

Yet even Zoom has its problems. Beyond its much publicized privacy troubles, there is the more basic problem that it shares with all other video calling software: The calls themselves are often terrible. Voices drop in and out, streams regularly freeze, and even the sound quality is subpar. Despite the fact that videoconferencing technology has been around for a couple of decades, the actual reliability and quality of calls hasn't kept pace. Unlike, say, video games or streaming video, the leaps in quality simply haven't happened.

At least one reason this is true is that home WiFi is awful for many. The pandemic has forced people to sit in odd corners of their houses or apartments to get the best signal, an absurd reality in 2020. Yes, it's true, you can install a mesh network from companies like Eero (purchased by Amazon), Google, or Linksys, but those often cost hundreds of dollars. The basic functionality of the wireless tech most people rely on needs to get a lot better.

As we navigate this shift, it's worth remembering that technology should be intuitive and seamless. Anyone should be able to use it. Consider online shopping. While it is second nature to those who are used to it, novices are often baffled by how things work: the obscure magic through which certain products on Amazon are displayed, how to get the best prices, or why and which delivery fees and service charges are levied. Watching my parents try to navigate these things, I'm half tempted to suggest all tech should be judged by a kind of ""senior standard"": Can an elderly person without much experience with technology use a service or gadget? If the answer is no, then it's time to rethink it.

Recently, famed investor and inventor Marc Andreessen published a provocative essay imploring people to build things again in the aftermath of the pandemic. It was the kind of call to action some found inspiring and others eyeroll-inducing. But I think it's possible that the skeptical reaction to the essay is rooted in the fact that it asked for more new technology, rather than encouraging a change in how tech is delivered, or the role it plays in our lives. Yes, let's build more, but let's make the tools we have work better for more people so their benefits can be more evenly distributed.

The things we can do with technology are incredible: We can talk to people around the world, enrich our lives, inform ourselves. During this pandemic, the internet and social media have been a lifeline for billions. Still, perhaps like people did once those early cars proved inadequate, we might look at what we have now and ask: Why isn't this better?

"Maybe soothing phrases come out of unsoothing times, or maybe it's just coincidence that I started noticing the phrase ""you're fine"" being substituted for ""no problem,"" or ""no worries,"" or ""That's okay!"" several months ago. I was in the vestibule of my gym, where people take off hats and coats and change their shoes, and there was a crowd, as usual, due to people leaving one class as others arrived for another. That's when it happened: I noticed that I was blocking someone, and I scooted over to let them by. I also said ""Sorry!"" and got my very first — or at least, first in memory — ""you're fine.""

There's not really an appropriate response to ""you're fine"" — ""you're correct, I am fine!"" — so I just smiled and grabbed my stuff and left.

Then it happened again. And again. It was like seeing Ugg boots for the first time and suddenly noticing them everywhere. In fact, maybe ""you're fine"" is the Ugg boot of apology responses: soft, bland but inoffensive, not very good in the snow. (Unless ""no worries"" is the Ugg boot of such phrases, because, you know, both are from Australia.)

I couldn't decide how I felt about ""you're fine."" On one hand, it seemed perfectly nice. I want to be fine. Fine is fine! But then, fine is just fine, not great or special or lovely. And who is this relative stranger to tell me I'm fine? Maybe I'm NOT fine!

On the other hand, ""no problem"" is plagued with issues, at least according to curmudgeons who does not truck with such informality, and ""no worries,"" while great with an Australian accent, always sounds a bit odd coming off my tongue. (For some reason it works in email or text, where ""you're fine"" would play as odd or perhaps dismissive.)

I took to the internet, land of answers (right and wrong) to find out more. Urban Dictionary was, as usual, little help. I was happy to see the question of ""you're fine"" tackled on a Quora page, but mostly I just learned that people really hate it when someone says ""no problem"" after someone else says thank you, which I personally have no problem with.

In the real world, a.k.a. on my Facebook page, I also found an array of ""you're fine"" haters. ""It feels like it's answering a question that wasn't asked,"" one person explained. Another — who thinks the expression is distinctly millennial, probably originating with the Kardashians — despised it thoroughly: ""I hate, hate, hate 'you're fine.' It belies entitlement. It's like you're saying, 'There is a certain level of treatment I expect from people at all times, but don't worry, you are still on good terms with me. You're fine.'""

I was provided a bevy of other linguistic go-tos for an awkward encounter, and sometimes even reasons for the preferences: ""no problem""; ""it's all good""; ""no worries""; ""I'm sorry""; ""it happens"" — with a smile; ""s'okay""; and, weirdest of all, ""hmmm.""

It turns out that what you say when someone apologizes was a psychological check-in for many, an apology-Rorschach of sorts, particularly for the excessive sorry-ers: ""Okay, this thread is making me realize I might be a pushover, because I *always* say 'no, that was my fault, I'm sorry!'"" said one. ""Sometimes I say 'my bad' like maybe I was in the way in the 1st place?"" offered another. A third weighed in: ""I say sorry, too. The whole 'sorry' thing is so loaded as you know, but when I say it it's more like 'I'm sorry this situation happened and one or both of us was inconvenienced' rather than using the word to admit guilt or responsibility…""

Perhaps ""you're fine"" has sprung up as a reaction to acknowledged sorry-overuse, when there's no need to apologize for something that was an accident and unintentional in the first place. There's plenty of other, more important stuff to be ""sorry"" about, right? It also puts the person to whom supposed harm has been done in charge of expressing their own emotions, making it direct rather than simply reactive. In a time in deep autonomy, it kinda makes sense.

For some, it came from a place of kindness. One Facebook friend explained, ""I think ""you're fine"" is my normal response. Usually, the person is jumpy and trying to quickly get out of the way. I think in my head it's a way to let them know to be calm and not rush to move."" Another said, ""Relatedly, our son with autism was making sounds on the subway and generally being rambunctious, and this lady looked at me and said, 'You're fine' and I could have melted with gratitude …""

Freelance journalist Nona Willis Aronowitz is a self-professed ""you're fine""-r, an expression she thinks hails from the West Coast (Kardashian or otherwise). ""I hear it in L.A.,"" she says. ""In the last 5 years it's come into my life and I've fully embraced it."" Maybe it's a match for sunny weather and convertibles, because ""I think it's such a perfect way to assuage any feeling of social awkwardness or discomfort as opposed to a rote 'it's okay.' It's so affirmative, so warm and lovely. When somebody says 'you're fine' to me it makes me feel so good, all is right with the world. It's the equivalent of patting someone on the shoulder.""

Of course, some people hate that, too. But if you're saying ""you're fine,"" you're probably … fine."	-15.18
"President Trump is about to make history as the first twice-impeached president of the United States. That's double Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, and two more times than Richard Nixon was ever impeached.

That Democrats want to impeach Trump is a classic ""Dog Bites Man"" story in that it is unremarkable. Many of them favored his impeachment before he even took office and some are now talking about ways to impeach him even after he is gone. The real change is that a growing number of Republicans favor Trump's removal from office, too. And while most of the confirmed GOP supporters are from swing districts where Democratic voters are plentiful, have serious foreign policy differences with Trump, or both, that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is rumored to privately favor the latest impeachment bid is a story of ""Man Bites Dog"" caliber.

McConnell is said to approve of impeachment as a way to purge Trump from the Republican Party. Axios reported the Kentucky Republican could go so far as to vote to convict, even if he might delay a vote until the final hours of Trump's presidency.

It is hard to fault lawmakers who hid under their desks during the Trump dead-enders' attack on the Capitol for wanting to ring down the curtain on this divisive presidency. Trump was, at a minimum, grossly negligent in his rhetoric ahead of the MAGA siege, seeming indifferent even to the safety of his own vice president, and his efforts to call off the violent rampage while it was in progress were wholly inadequate. And these are charitable descriptions of his conduct.

All that may be a sufficient basis for impeachment, even at this late date. But let us not pretend it is likely to calm the passions roiling the country. If you believe, however erroneously, that the election was stolen from the only political figure you think listens to or represents you, that the courts and other national institutions ignored it or were complicit, and that the system was irrevocably corrupt, would the political class' 11th-hour removal of that figure from office — even on a bipartisan basis — coupled with a ban on his running in the future, really convince you otherwise?

These may all be fanciful, even destructive, things to believe. And this does not describe the views of all 74 million Americans who voted for Trump. But it describes the deeply held views of enough of them, and not only because Trump himself has been filling their heads with claims about the 2020 election that range from the questionable to the nonsensical. The case for Trump's impeachment must rest solely on judging his behavior and setting a standard for future presidents. The idea that it will lead to less ""Stop the Steal"" agitation rather than more makes about as much sense as a Lin Wood tweet.

Much of the last four years' commentary about how Republicans such as McConnell have dealt with Trump has ignored the fact that he was the choice of GOP voters. ""For those Republicans who fear their own constituents: Liz Cheney lives in Wyoming,"" tweeted Never Trump commentator Tom Nichols. ""If she can do this, you weenies can do this too.""

But ""fear"" of one's ""own constituents"" is also a form of democratic accountability, the same principle rightly invoked in defense of Joe Biden's electoral victory against dubious and in some cases knowingly dishonest claims. Would anyone descend on the nation's capital to protest a contested election involving Liz Cheney or Fred Upton?

This does not mean capitulating to the mob or ignoring the 81 million who voted for Biden. ""Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgement; and he betrays you instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion,"" said Edmund Burke. George H.W. Bush invoked this quotation from the conservative statesman when he voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968 against the objections of some in the Texas congressional district.

It does, however, mean that elected representatives have obligations to their constituents. Republican leaders have a legitimacy crisis with their own voters. That is what created the conditions that led to Trump's rise, that made his presidency thinkable in a way that Michele Bachmann's or Tom Tancredo's was not.

For the Republican Party to truly move past the last four years, its leadership class must attempt to determine why so much of their constituency believes Trump offers them more than the party establishment does. If the only answer they can come up with is ""because our voters are stupid,"" their struggles will continue."	-15.18
"The nomination of Lloyd Austin to serve as secretary of defense may serve as a microcosm of how difficult it will be for President-elect Joe Biden to manage the competing demands of the unwieldy coalition that put him in office.

As Biden assembled his national security team, some feared liberal hawks were once again circling the White House. The incoming president is something of a wildcard on foreign policy. In the Senate, he was often a liberal hawk himself, not only voting for the Iraq war but playing a large role in rebuffing fellow Democrats who wanted an authorization of force that did more to constrain President George W. Bush. As vice president, Biden's advice to President Barack Obama tended to be more dovish.

Thus progressives grew concerned about Michèle Flournoy, the erstwhile frontrunner for secretary of defense. She had a record of boosting interventions in Libya and Syria, promoting the 2009 Afghanistan troop surge, and endorsing the framework of ""preventive war"" that led to the Iraq invasion, though (or perhaps because of all this) she was held in high regard by the Washington military establishment.

Opposition to Flournoy percolated, and Biden faced a Senate that will, in the best-case scenario for his party, be split 50-50 and only controlled by the Democrats due to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even that breakdown would have given Flournoy little margin for error. But there was a catch: She was not entirely without liberal support and would have been the first woman to serve as secretary of defense.

But Biden, also under pressure to increase the racial diversity of senior Cabinet posts, had another option in Austin. ""He was the first African-American general officer to lead an Army corps in combat and the first African American to command an entire theater of war; if confirmed, he will be the first African American to helm the Defense Department — another milestone in a barrier-breaking career dedicated to keeping the American people secure,"" Biden wrote in The Atlantic.

Perfect, right? Not so fast! Austin's military credentials, a major reason he was being selected to run the Pentagon in the first place, are a problem for some progressives. Less than seven years removed from being a general, Congress would need to grant him a waiver to serve as secretary of defense. Some Democrats, interested in preserving civilian control of the military, are not eager to give him one.

""This is becoming a trend, and I don't like it,"" protested Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat. Biden points out that President Trump's first secretary of defense, James Mattis, received a waiver. But for some Democrats, that's precisely the problem. ""Waiving the law should happen no more than once in a generation,"" Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, told Mattis at his 2017 confirmation hearing. ""Therefore, I will not support a waiver for future nominees."" Austin faces the same complicated Senate math as Flournoy.

The left faces difficult choices over its priorities. Is it more important to move away from the John Bolton-lite foreign policy favored by much of the Democratic Party's national security elite, or to ensure diversity? If identity politics is the greater priority, should intersectionality dictate whether it is preferable to tap the first Black or female secretary of defense? It's also the case that many progressives would quietly like to see an administration to the left of Obama's, however much the rank-and-file continues to admire the 44th president.

Yet Biden doesn't owe his election to the left alone. His electoral coalition stretched all the way from far-left Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to disillusioned Republicans like John Kasich, who actually got more speaking time at the Democratic convention than the rising New York congresswoman. While foreign policy no longer breaks down neatly along conventional left-right lines — Trump wants a speedier exit from Afghanistan than some of the names in Biden's rolodex, for example — the suburban Republican leaners who were the difference makers for the president-elect in the Electoral College may not want a progressive-run military or trust that it would be sufficient to keep the country safe for the next four years.

""To govern is to choose."" So said the veteran British politician Nigel Lawson. As Biden prepares to govern, he is going to face a lot of difficult choices. The secretary of defense is just one."	-15.18
"If President Trump succeeds in replacing retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy with a stalwart conservative, thus creating a mostly-solid five-vote bloc on the Court, it will represent the culmination of a multi-decade effort by the conservative movement to reshape the American judiciary.

At a time when conservatives fret about the country slipping away from them, they should ponder this achievement and what lessons they can take from it.

Most people don't realize it, but this is an intellectual achievement. Sure, Republicans needed to win elections and fight appointment battles to have gotten to this point. They would never be in a position to get ""their"" Supreme Court pick through if they didn't control the Senate and the White House. But they also very much needed a deep pool of qualified judges, and that wouldn't have happened if those jurists hadn't been shaped by a robust and credible intellectual movement.

It's worth remembering that in the 1970s, when Roe v. Wade stunned conservatives and altered the shape of American politics forever, the doctrines of constitutional interpretation favored by conservatives, such as strict constructionism, originalism, and textualism, were basically completely ignored in the academy and in legal thinking.

When Antonin Scalia, lion of originalism, died in early 2016, eulogies focused on his inimitable writing style and his advocacy of originalism, while noting that originalism is still a minority view on the bench. True enough, but this missed the extent of originalism's influence. Though Scalia, because of his position on the Supreme Court and his unique eloquence, was the most visible advocate of originalism, he was merely the tip of the iceberg. And in the decades between Roe and now, originalism has become impossible to ignore. Non-originalist lawyers and judges now have to find some way to address originalist concerns. As a result, originalism's influence extends far beyond its niche of devotees.

This was accomplished, first and foremost, through intellectual leadership. Through organizations like the Federalist Society, which enabled young brilliant conservative jurists to network, get trained into the intellectual tradition, and then contribute to it, the conservative movement built an intellectual vanguard that was the necessary precondition of everything that followed.

This model, of intellectual leadership as the first step to policy success, used to be the blueprint for the great conservative successes of the '80s and '90s, such as supply-side economics, welfare reform, and school choice. These movements show that successful transformative political movements invest in intellectual leadership. It really has worked brilliantly in the courts. Conservatives have managed over decades to change the shape of the American judiciary and to shape jurisprudence in their direction.

I am sad to report, however, that today, this type of conservative intellectual leadership is largely gone. In policy area after policy area, conservatives do have very smart people, yes, but are on the wrong side of a ""wonk gap"" with the left.

What's more terrifying is that very few people on the right seem to think this is a problem.

Today the Republican Party has more political control of branches of government, at the federal and state levels, than at any point in recent history. And it doesn't seem to know what to do with it.

It's easy to blame President Trump. But this problem predates him. Witness the failure to replace ObamaCare: Long before Trump, conservatives had ceded intellectual leadership on health care. After years of bleating ""Repeal and replace!"" conservatives were like the dog that caught the car. They had no intellectually coherent policy to make good on the ""replace"" part of that promise.

The contrast between success in the judiciary and failure in areas such as health care shows that when conservatives invest in intellectual leadership, they can win. And if they don't, they lose. I wish they'd notice."	-15.18
"The internet exploded in fury recently when Attorney General Jeff Sessions quoted the Bible to defend his policies in separating migrant children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order,"" Sessions said, when defending President Trump's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy. ""Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves. Consistent and fair application of the law is in itself a good and moral thing, and that protects the weak and protects the lawful.""

The passage in question, chapter 13 of the Apostle Paul's Letter to the Romans, reads, in part: ""Let every person be subject to the governing authorities; for there is no authority except from God, and those authorities that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.""

Some people, mostly secularists unfamiliar with the Bible, took the passage to mean that Christians should just obey any government, no matter how awful. Other people, mainly Christians, argued that Sessions is full of it, because the Bible clearly preaches an open-door immigration policy.

They're both wrong. And it's important to understand why.

The Bible is a tricky text to interpret. Some people think this is because it's a grab bag of various texts from many centuries; you can make that argument, but there's no important text from human history that is straightforward to interpret, probably because otherwise, people wouldn't find them so interesting, and they wouldn't tell us interesting things about this messy reality we inhabit. The Bible is unclear, but so are Plato's dialogues, Shakespeare's plays, and the Constitution of the United States.

But there's another reason the Bible is so tricky to understand: While there are so many Christian splinter groups and eccentrics that you can always find someone somewhere who argued something or other, the broad tradition of mainstream Christian orthodoxy has held that Christian doctrine ""works"" by holding seemingly-contradictory beliefs together. Thus, the Bible at times seems to suggest that Jesus was a human being like anybody else, and at other times that he was divine; at times, it seems to suggest that there is only one God, and at others that there is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Which is it? ""Both,"" Christianity answers.

And this is true when it comes to Romans 13, which is both a very complex and a very important piece of Biblical text. Some reacted to its seeming message (""Bow to the State!"") with allergy. Thus we get headlines like ""Sessions cites Bible passage used to defend slavery in defense of separating immigrant families,"" which is rather like those people who say you shouldn't listen to Richard Wagner because he was Hitler's favorite composer.

Like everything else in this world, Romans 13 makes sense within its broader context. And in the New Testament, this broader context is a big, raised middle finger at the government of the day, the Roman Empire. After all, Rome killed Jesus. And Paul is not short of contempt for the Roman Empire, which he likens to Old Testament-enemies of the Jews like Pharaoh and Babylon, and even at one points asserts that it is controlled by the Devil. So much for government worship.

So, what the heck? Well, Paul writes Romans 13 to say basically two things: First, just because the Roman Empire, and indeed most governments, are awful, doesn't mean that all government in principle is bad. And secondly, he wants to tell his audience that, while they should hold the Roman Empire in contempt and resist it however they can, they should not do so by breaking the law.

The first point, like Jesus' famous line about giving back to Caesar, is important, and not just because progressives who would like to strike it out because of its historic association with all sorts of government misdeeds should remember that it's also the justification for all the government programs they like. But because, even as it legitimizes government, it downgrades it. Again, you have to get the Roman Empire context: In Rome, government wasn't just absolute, it was literally divine. ""Roma"" was a goddess; all public offices were also religious offices; and executions for high crimes were sacrifices to the gods. So Romans 13 puts government back in its place: Yes, God wants there to be governments because otherwise we would have anarchy, but governments aren't divine. They're just institutions for raising taxes and maintaining public order.

The second point — to resist without breaking the law — is important, too, because it tells us that Paul was inventing something utterly unprecedented: peaceful resistance to an unjust government. Resist Rome, but be good citizens. The mode of interacting with public authority that Jesus first modeled, but that Paul and the other early leaders of the Church implemented, would be the blueprint for future successful nonviolent resistance movements, like Gandhi's and Martin Luther King Jr.'s.

So was Sessions justified in his little exegesis? Well, yes and no. In an important sense, yes, because Romans 13 means government in general is good, and it is impossible to have a functioning government without borders and enforcing those borders. This is important because too many Christians cite the Bible's many verses enjoining ""kindness to the stranger"" as if they were a Biblical warrant for an open-door policy. But they're not. What's more, Romans 13 also means that civil servants have a duty to faithfully apply the law, and as attorney general, Sessions' job description isn't to put into application what he thinks would be good policy, but what is actually on the books.

At the same time, Sessions was clearly disingenuous. Separating migrant families goes beyond just applying the law. More broadly, in practice, and by design, attorneys general have a lot of flexibility in how they apply the law, and Sessions clearly gets a kick out of applying it in a highly restrictionist way. After all, there is no formal law requiring children to be separated from their families. Also, Christians who don't want to apply laws they deem unjust do have an option: resign. To Trump's occasional chagrin, Sessions doesn't seem to have considered that. And everybody knows why: He's putting immigration restrictions in place not because he's a civil servant who puts his own wishes aside and dutifully follows the rules, but because he believes them to be greatly desirable. So if he wants to defend his actions based on the Bible, he should defend the merits of his actions, rather than hide behind Romans 13.

But this little skirmish might have served some purpose, by drawing attention to what the Bible says about immigration policy. America's immigration policy for more than 20 years has been to have one set of written laws and another set of unwritten ones, making a mockery of the rule of law and playing no small part in the delegitimization of the political process that has empowered demagogues like Trump. When Sessions, expounding on Romans 13, said that applying the law protects both the weak and the lawful, he might have been disingenuous with regard to his own actions, but he was certainly right in general. So, there's a lesson here for both sides: Just as conservatives need to wrestle with the plainly clear Biblical verses about sympathy to the stranger, progressives need to account for the clear Biblical verses about the necessity for sound government and rule of law."	-15.18
"For his wildly entertaining new murder-mystery movie Knives Out, writer-director Rian Johnson has lined up an all-star cast, nearly every one of whom is playing a fabulously wealthy creep. Don Johnson plays the philandering spouse of a snippy real estate mogul, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Chris Evans is their stubbornly unserious playboy son. Michael Shannon plays his millionaire father's staunchly right-wing business manager, raising a teenage son who's a Neo-Nazi internet troll. And Toni Collette is a self-styled social media influencer, burning through her late husband's family fortune.

Most of these characters are — whether they realize it or not — moochers. The clan's patriarch is the mega-successful mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey, played by Christopher Plummer. When he dies under mysterious circumstances, a shrewd southern dandy detective named Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) scrutinizes the potential suspects one-by-one. And one-by-one, he reveals that even if they didn't actually kill Harlan, they've spent most of their lives bleeding him dry ... and then congratulating themselves for being self-made millionaires.

This premise may seem like an aggressively woke spin on a classic genre. And I haven't even mentioned Harlan's beloved nurse: an undocumented immigrant's daughter named Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), who helps steer Benoit's investigation, even as her late employer's family belittles and marginalizes her. (One running joke is that no Thrombey can remember her nationality; it's all pretty much ""somewhere brown-skinned people come from"" to them.)

But while Johnson definitely intends Knives Out to be a commentary on the political and class divisions of 2019, he's not breaking new ground here. The detective/mystery genre has long been fairly radical. In Raymond Chandler's novels, some swell walks through Philip Marlowe's door, and before long the P.I.is bouncing between elegant mansions and sordid dens of iniquity, sniffing out the scandals that the rich and famous would rather he bury. Distrusting the upper-class isn't just a recurring theme in these stories; it's a plot-driver.

Knives Out isn't inspired by the noir shadings of Chandler so much as it is by '70s TV detective shows and Agatha Christie's drawing-room mysteries. But all of these largely share Chandler's nuanced understanding of how people too often conflate having a lot of money with cultural superiority.

On the surface, Knives Out is very much like one of the star-studded old movie adaptations of Christie novels like Death on the Nile and Murder on the Orient Express — the kind of films where the posters featured all the actors' faces in tiny boxes. Much of the fun of the movie comes from watching skilled pros like Collette, Curtis, Johnson, and Shannon lean into playing such broadly malevolent, fiercely selfish, unselfconsciously smug plutocrats. Evans and Craig especially look to be having a ball, loosed from the demands of playing the stodgy Captain America and James Bond, now free to go broad as walking, talking cartoons.

Structurally, Johnson borrows from Sleuth and Deathtrap, two movies (both based on plays) that spring huge surprises every 30 minutes or so, defying the audience's presumptions. But Johnson also, somewhat incongruously, takes from Columbo, a TV show that usually told viewers more than even the hero knew. A Columbo episode nearly always starts with the who, how, and why of a murder, then spends the next hour or so following LAPD homicide detective Lt. Columbo as he pecks away at snobby killers who are certain they've committed the perfect crime.

The Rockford Files, Barnaby Jones, Cannon. Each of these shows also pitted lumpy, world-weary types against the kind of glamorous people that '70s TV viewers might've read about in, well, People. Of all the classic '70s detective series though, Columbo was the most overt with its class-conflict themes.

Peter Falk played Columbo as a seemingly in-over-his-head LAPD lifer, clad in a rumpled trench coat and driving a beat-up old car. He'd disarm suspects with his obsequiousness, peppering them with deceptively flattering inquiries into the lifestyles of the rich and famous. How do all their fancy, expensive gadgets work? What's the best way to pick a good bottle of wine? What does a bigwig do all day? Before they knew what had happened, Columbo had asked the one question that exposed their biggest mistake.

Knives Out waits until roughly the end of its first act before jumping into an extended flashback that reveals how Harlan died and who was involved. Then, Columbo-style, we watch as the chief suspect shadows Benoit, desperately trying to steer the detective away from the clues. It's all wonderfully suspenseful, watching a smart P.I. piece together what we already know.

Benoit Blanc is ultimately more of a Christie or a Dashiell Hammett-style hero than a Columbo. He's dapper and eloquent, and he projects a know-it-all confidence that makes his quarry nervous. Still, like many of the best detectives, he combines a deep cynicism about human nature with a sentimental attachment to underdogs and lost causes.

Knives Out can be savage in its depiction of the Thrombey family. But what makes it such a crowd-pleaser is that Johnson also expresses a reassuring optimism that human decency will prevail, and that justice will favor the hard-working and good-hearted over the pernicious and self-serving — no matter how loaded they may be.

This, in essence, is the appeal of these stories where a Miss Marple or a Sam Spade wears a criminal down. It's not that the great mystery writers think millionaires are inherently evil. It's more that they recognize the common, infuriating belief among aristocrats that money should buy them the benefit of the doubt. Their stacks of cash are meant to insulate them from any consequences.

In another Columbo-esque move in Knives Out, the suspects play along with the investigation until it starts to cut a little too close to the truth, at which point they presume they have the power to end it. They're not used to being questioned, so they figure their cooperation is wholly voluntary.

But the most original twist in this rollicking, unpredictable whodunnit doesn't involve a key clue or a shocking revelation. It's more about the way the detective hero peels away the Thrombeys' defenses, by forcing them to admit how little they've actually accomplished in their lives.

In some mysteries, the rich pay any price to keep the public from finding out about some sexual indiscretion or long-buried crime. In Knives Out, the scandal is more insidious: It's that these wealthy people who demand deference have never really earned a penny of their income. It's a secret that runs so deep, even the people carrying it are clueless.

"Throughout the final, tortured moments of the 2020 presidential campaign, Donald Trump took to referring to his rival, Joe Biden, as the head of ""the Biden crime family."" But as psychologist Mary L. Trump, the soon-to-be-erstwhile commander-in-chief's niece, and author of Too Much and Never Enough, has suggested, some of Trump's statements are, in fact, projections of his own behavior. Indeed, Trump's alpha male posturing and affected bravado — which he used to foment a personal brand of being a savvy businessman and a mover-and-shaker blessed with raw cunning — is bound up in the mythos of the mobster as portrayed in pop culture, film, and TV. However, the realities that seep through that mythos, like blood on carpet, demonstrate why Trump is leaving the White House at a record low in approval. Trump may have tried to affect the steely suaveness of the hyper-competent crime boss, but he failed because, in fact, he's a blundering thug.

The grand figure of the gangster mythos is Marlon Brando's tuxedoed Vito Corleone, brows furrowed with the pain of being such an intense strategic and tactical genius, speaking with an eloquent pathos about loyalty. His famous-to-the-point-of-parody offer to get what he wants by making his rival ""an offer he can't refuse"" has its sleazier echo in Trump's self-described ""perfect"" phone calls to Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, asking him to ""do me a favor, though"" by launching a fake investigation into Joe Biden, and in his post-election conversation with Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of State, in which he said, ""I only need 11,000 votes … Give me a break … Or we can keep it going, but that's not fair to the voters of Georgia because they're going to see what happened.""

It turned out that these men — and 81,283,485 voters — could very much refuse Trump's offers.

Trump's inability to muscle his way to victory is a testament to how the pop culture perception of the all-powerful kingpin collides with the more finite realities of wheeling and dealing in real life. ""He knows how to perform [the role of a gangster], with the bullying and aggression,"" says Joe Loya, critically acclaimed author of The Man Who Outgrew His Prison Cell, podcaster of Bank Robber Diaries, and former bank robber. ""He kept trying to do the thing that mobsters do where they don't say the thing [they're asking for]. Finally, he realizes nothing he's saying is sticking, so he comes out and says it. He's a buffoon.""

To Loya, this highly performative aspect of Trump's persona — the part that will make a show of firing people on TV or by tweet, but kowtows to men like Vladimir Putin — is why he fails to achieve the mettle of a successful gangster, or world leader: ""If this guy walked down the prison tier, everyone would recognize him as puffery.""

Trump is no Don Corleone. But Loya does see similarities between Trump and the more bullish scion of the Corleone family, Sonny, ""who rose to the top, ran the family, but only for a moment because he was undone by his hubris. There's this hubris among certain people that ensures the most glorious moments of their entire lives are tied to their doom.""

Trump's own pride may be his ultimate undoing. His refusal to believe that he could have been honestly defeated in the 2020 election nurtured an uprising at the Capitol that prompted a historic second impeachment. The fetid potpourri of likely forthcoming charges, indictments, and civil suits will bring financial and legal perils when he leaves office. His personal brand is now so tarnished that organizations ranging from his bank lenders to the PGA want nothing to do with him. His hubris has its echoes in Sonny, but also in Fredo Corleone, whose sense of entitlement as the ""stepped over"" son leads him to betray the family — and, eventually, to disgrace and a watery grave. Loya opines that ""Trump's glory is that he made it to the presidency, and it walks hand in hand with his doom.""

One wonders if taking a remotely humane approach to the coronavirus pandemic, as opposed to blustering racist incentive about the ""China Virus"" and publicly belittling Dr. Anthony Fauci, or showing empathy to the widows of fallen soldiers and people displaced by hurricanes, or simply not mocking Biden for his compassion toward his only surviving son, might have given Trump an advantage in the election. After all, Vito Corleone first amasses his influence in the neighborhoods of Little Italy, influence that will form the pillars of his empire, by taking care of his community: In Godfather II, young Vito tries to persuade (via a substantial sum of money) a landlord to rescind the eviction of a widow who can't bear to give up her son's beloved dog — when he can't, Vito doesn't overtly threaten or bully the landlord, he simply suggests he talk to people in the neighborhood. After getting a clear sense of who he's dealing with, the landlord allows to the widow and her dog to stay, at a reduced rent.

Yet this was clearly not a lesson Trump and Co. internalized (Steve Bannon's talk of ""going to the mattresses"" aside). The part of the mafia mythos that most appeals to Trump and his supporters is ""the notion that nothing is more important than respect and loyalty to The Boss, above all else, including anything like, say, laws,"" explains Tod Goldberg, bestselling author of Gangsterland, Gangster Nation, and The Low Desert: Gangster Stories. This mentality of ""one nation, under the Don"" has Trump preparing to issue around 100 pardons and commutations — including ""controversial ones secured or doled out to political allies … that he could benefit from post presidency.""

The problem, Goldberg says, ""is that if they ever watched those films and TV shows beyond the first act or pilot, they'd know that someone always snitches. Plus, the organization is peopled by narcissistic sociopaths.""

In real-life, Trump himself could be considered the ultimate snitch, sharing state secrets with our foes, mouthing off with details about criminal conspiracies in interviews with Lester Holt, and live-tweeting his way to a second impeachment. ""He talks too much,"" says Loya, bluntly. ""If he was a gangster and he came to prison … and they saw the way he talked to the Russians … they'd see this guy … as operating from a position of weakness. If he came to prison as a gangster, and not as a president, he'd have holes put in him.""

Greg Olear, a political columnist and the author of Dirty Rubles: An Introduction to Trump/Russia, has done extensive research into Trump's real-life underworld connections, and how they emboldened him as the gangster-in-chief. ""Donald Trump is a second-generation mob money launderer. His father, Fred Trump, was the same generation as Meyer Lansky, who invented money laundering,"" Olear says. ""While Trump has been mob his whole life, he's not a mobster or a mob boss, as we understand it. He's a front man."" He likens Trump to a character in the Sopranos canon — a character whose recklessness and desperation obliterates his life: ""The closest figure to Trump in mafia films is Davey Scatino, the gambling addict who gets in debt to Tony Soprano, and winds up overleveraging his business, Ramsey Outdoor, to pay him back.""

Despite the carefully curated Hollywood image of a La Cosa Nostra led by men who brood artfully over the nature of family and vengeance, in reality, the mob is often populated by guys who live by the dull sparks of their baser instincts. ""The best mob movie to look at, if you hope to understand Trump and his time in office, is Donnie Brasco,"" says Goldberg. ""It's a cat and mouse between the mafia and the FBI, but it's also about feckless mobsters who don't realize they're dinosaurs walking around the day before the asteroid hits, that society has moved beyond them, along with technology, and that quaint notions like omerta don't hold much sway anymore … the crimes perpetrated in Donnie Brasco are so brazen and stupid, one can only ask, 'Did they really think they'd get away with that?'""

The image of the masterful schemer — Michael Corleone orchestrating the synchronized murders of his foes; Jimmy Conway plotting the Lufthansa heist; or Tony Soprano becoming the boss of New Jersey — turned the gangster into one of pop culture's enduring outlaws, but it meets with a blunter reality. On-screen mafiosos have their moments of humanity, like Vito Corleone holding his infant son on his lap, saying, ""Michael, your father loves you very much."" Or Jimmy Conway weeping over the murder of his friend, Tommy. Or, most famously, Tony Soprano's protective tenderness over his ducklings. In reality, mob bosses are hideous, narcissistic, and cruel. ""I don't think Trump took his cues from mob movies as much as he took them from actual mobsters,"" explains Goldberg, ""The way he dresses, his hair, his morbid sense of humor, his total lack of shame and empathy, the way he treats women like chew toys — it's hard to write a character like that, because he becomes so intensely unsympathetic that the audience just pities him."""	-15.18
"Shrill's second season opens with its heroine, Annie Easton (Aidy Bryant), sprinting through the night after hurling a flowerpot through the window of her online troll's prized SUV. This vision of a fat woman's body, animated by an adrenalized, exhilarated grace and fury — not a guilty impulse to sweat herself svelte — continues Annie's story of seismic self-revelation. Her body is not unlike my body: Both of us require liberal amounts of chub rub to make it through summer skirt season. We are women who Peter Paul Rubens would paint and Jillian Michaels would punish. Women who look like me on-screen are usually contestants on The Biggest Loser or cautionary sad sacks like This is Us' Kate Pearson (Chrissy Metz), whose main arcs are downward spirals of weight-related shame and surges of determination to finally get thin.

Resisting this narrative about how exactly fat women should be has been deeply lonely and profoundly liberating — sometimes, all at once. Lindy West, whose memoir gives Shrill its name and its plump pumping fist of a heart, is a spiritual Sherpa for me and other aspiringly self-possessed fat women. The show's first season, which debuted in March 2019, felt like a road map of my own escape from a death of a thousand micro-aggressions: Annie tells off rude strangers online or on the street and calls out her mother for a lifetime of diet talk; demands that the scruffily hunky dude who asks her to leave their trysts through the backdoor treat her like a real girlfriend; and avenges herself against her size-biased boss, who says he's only ""concerned for her health,"" by publishing a cri de Couer called ""Hello, I'm Fat,"" and then quitting. The first season is unabashedly about Annie deciding that she will no longer live a stunted half-life spent apologizing for her body — that she will take up as much space as she damn well pleases. She will be fat and loud.

In this regard, Shrill isn't solely indebted to its source memoir. It shares thematic kinship and riot grrl ethos with Sarai Walker's Dietland, which also brings its plus-size heroine, Plum, to the point where she can either choose to starve herself in body and spirit or find abundance in cathartic rage. But Dietland the novel ends with this catharsis (the series was canceled right as Plum takes up with an all-woman paramilitary squad). If Shrill had ended for good as Annie flees the sound of breaking glass, all I would have ever seen on-screen is a cartography of my own anger — never a sense of how to live beyond it.

Fortunately, Shrill returns to answer the question of what can grow in the broken-open earth of a life. If last season hinged on grand moments of epiphany — like the Venusian pool party of fat babes in teeny-weeny bikinis — this season finds Annie taking subtler, though no less significant steps, to evolve as a writer, partner, and friend. Annie's relationship to her body, which was the main verse of Shrill's inaugural season, now becomes a familiar chord humming in the background. She finds her groove as a journalist and owns her ambition, even if it means tempering her pride. She comes to accept that her mother isn't a tireless caregiver or a constant scold, just a mortal, loving woman who still gets tired and cranky. She questions whether her lover's obvious affection for her can overcome their intellectual incompatibility. Much of her arc this season is remarkable precisely because it's not remarkable — at least, not when it belongs to thin, or ""straight size"" heroines.

Annie's desire to see her darling, but dim-bulb, boyfriend apply himself and hold down a job wouldn't be out of place on New Girl or Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Her complicated relationship with a brilliant yet prickly mentor who can enrage and inspire her carries echoes of Peggy Olson. Even Annie's Rubenesque best friend, Fran (Lolly Adefope), inhabits a storyline that could easily appear on The L Word: Generation Q, where the woman who has floated from lover to lover must finally hit the ground, and, in growing up, heal the old aches from coming out to her mother. Giving Annie and Fran normal, ""straight size"" problems, means that, well, they're normal people. Their lives don't orbit around their fatness. Normalizing fat bodies is a radical act — especially when the term obesity epidemic practically comes with its own scare quotes; fitness experts like Michaels publicly concern-troll Lizzo's health (never mind that Lizzo 100 percent dances and plays wind instruments on stage for many hours multiple times a week); and most of the fat women we see on screen are either relegated as token best friends or foregrounded in their desperation to lose weight.

Shrill still delivers robust barbs against sizeism — this season skewers the capitalist hollowing-out of ""body positivity"" — while demonstrating that Annie also has a life of challenges and choices beyond her weight. She worries about readers finding her writing, or whether her father will remain healthy. Her body isn't the site of neurotic fixation, it is the vessel that carries her through the world. No more, no less. Just like anyone else. Just like me. I know how terrifying it is to leap out of the ever-whirring hamster wheel of diet culture. I hit my own breaking point, sick of diet shakes and powders that tasted like paste; tired of feeling like my life was over before I turned 30, just because I'll never be thin. When I started to pursue the life I wanted — full of rich foods and other pleasures, loving friends, and a career that excited me — I realized, with a blazing, incandescent clarity, that I'd been duped into hating myself for far too long.

But my anger doesn't absolve me from having to live in the world. I can't throw a flowerpot through every car window. Nowadays, my resistance is believing that I can be creatively and professionally fulfilled, that I can find community, and yes, even love. I already know how hard it is to be a fat woman. I want to see something else, the full spectrum of everyday experiences finally filtered through someone who looks like me. Shrill season two gives me something more valuable than more rage; it allows me, all of me, to be seen.

"""Insulting.""

That's what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called a reporter's question about why scientific terms, like ""verification,"" a mainstay of arms control treaties, weren't included in the joint letter that President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un signed on Tuesday during their summit in Singapore. In the document, North Korea recommits to denuclearization, but the statement itself gives no mention of how, exactly, the denuclearization process would be tracked and ensured.

The absence of such key words, which have come to define a generation of scientific and technical processes designed to ensure that states subject to treaties don't cheat, have generated suspicion among, well, everyone, that what Trump and Kim agreed to is the sum and substance of nothing at all. Nonsense, insists Pompeo. The document signed on Tuesday is just the tip of the iceberg, and it merely covers a vast number of ""modalities"" — his word — that negotiators between the two countries have already agreed to in principle and want to flesh out before putting them on paper.

To that end, there are two possibilities. One is that Trump and Kim did not speak using the lingua franca of arms control, and well-meaning, ambitious diplomats will have to push ahead without clear and direct guidance from their respective leaders. The other possibility is that the U.S. hasn't figured out exactly what it needs to verify. South Korea, China, and Japan might want to weigh in, too.

So what does ""verification"" actually mean? Exactly what you think: If a country declares to the world that it has X amount of Y — be it 10 ballistic missiles or 200 grams of highly enriched uranium — the counter-party to the treaty has to be reasonably certain that the country is not lying. So, they verify.

Verification regimes generally start with a country declaring whatever it is required to declare. Right now, we don't know what North Korea would need to declare — missiles? Weaponization technology? All of its uranium and plutonium stores? Its enrichment sites? Its manufacturing sites? Command and control facilities? Chemical and biological weapons research sites? Some? All?

After declaration, the country would allow for an initial round of intrusive inspections — think scientists with gadgets and sniffers and scopes peering through walls, counting, labeling, affixing things.

Then, the parties to the treaty agree on the terms of how the initial counts can be reverified, and if, for example, the treaty calls on the number of certain widgets to be less year-by-year, how the world will know that this has actually happened. This is the hard part, because a country can hide stuff at will. Facility inspections can be random, but North Korea will claim that its legitimate defense needs are subject to its own controls, so they'll want advance notice for inspections.

If North Korea's weapons technology is advanced, it might want inspectors to use scanning technology that verifies the fission/fusion qualities of a warhead or a stockpile without visual access to the ins and outs of the weapon itself. Conventional ballistic missiles have sophisticated deception devices that North Korea wouldn't want to share — and wouldn't be required to share in a nuclear arms treaty. In the language of arms control treaties, countries should be able to monitor ""capacities"" without necessarily having access to ""designs"" — unless the treaty prohibits specific designs.

Countries use spy satellites to track declared convoys of material and weapons. They can use embedded sensors, some of them covert, to track fissile material and radiation. But these mechanisms tend not to provide much in the way of value for arms control inspectors. What does work, however, is precisely what Kim probably does not want: lots of intrusive inspections, followed by persistent overflights of suspected sites, accompanied by drones that loiter over those sites for long periods of time.

A complete denuclearization treaty will require that monitors be able to watch the destruction of the nuclear stuff in the open. If it bears any similarity to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the U.S. and the USSR, it would also ban North Korea from encrypting data about any conventional ballistic missile tests it conducts, and require ""portal monitoring"" of declared facilities, data exchanges, and more.

No verification procedure can preclude cheating and counter-measures. So it makes sense that Pompeo is cagey on the specifics. But verification must happen. It is the most critical part of any path toward a nuke-free Korean Peninsula. Starting out on that path without a clear and outright mention of how verification will be achieved is foolish."	-15.18
"As I was stealthily gathering government secrets for the 2013 book I wrote about national security, a source of unimpeachable reliability tipped me off to a big one. The source told me that, in the course of a National Security Agency ""information assurance"" exercise, the agency discovered cellphone site emulators and even infrastructure around the White House and in downtown Washington, D.C., that did not belong to any companies actually licensed to install them.

The source told me they were ""ghost-grabbers."" At least one foreign intelligence agency managed to figure out a way to spy on cellphone calls originating from the area around the White House. Although White House security briefings routinely included warnings about foreign intelligence monitoring of personal and unencrypted cellphones, this was the first time that such an operation had been confirmed to exist in the heart of Washington, D.C.

This, I felt, was a pretty juicy story. I tried to find out more. My source provided some more details.

The NSA, intending to probe the U.S. Secret Service and the White House Communications Agency for security gaps in their communication practices, had obtained a map of the Communication Commission-approved cell towers and antennae in the area, most of them leased to Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint, and subleased to other carriers. Then, techs working for the NSA's ""Red Cell"" team used both conventional radio frequency scanners and some secret spy technology to intercept the cell signals that originated from various parts of the 18-acre campus that houses the White House and the executive offices of the president.

Using direction-finding gear, they were able to discern which towers most of the RF traffic was being directed to. They could then subject that traffic to tests: Could they see metadata patterns that revealed who was making a call to whom without having access to the phone records themselves? Could they, on the fly, intercept unencrypted communications, and listen to the content of the conversations? The NSA had obtained access to cellphone call records under its then-secret interpretation of Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Members of the Red Cell team who did the field monitoring could compare the signals they gathered with the location data the NSA collected in bulk and figure out which Secret Service and WHCA communications were vulnerable to interception. The Secret Service and WHCA had requested this exercise — the government wasn't secretly probing these agencies without their consent.

The last piece of information the source imparted to me was surprising. I asked if anyone — the FBI, maybe? — had done anything to any of the equipment they had found. Did they test it forensically? Did they remove it? What had happened next?

The source was not able to tell me.

As we completed the book, and as I reported on security as part of my job at National Journal, I tried to confirm the story. I could not. The FBI would not say if it had opened a counterintelligence investigation. The Secret Service wouldn't comment. Senior intelligence and national security officials would not bite. I could not find a second source. I did not have the story.

Fast forward to 2018. The Department of Homeland Security now officially acknowledges that there are numerous so-called ""IMSI carriers"" around Washington, D.C., cell site emulators that probably belong to foreign intelligence services. After Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the intelligence committee, wrote to DHS about ""rogue cell site simulators,"" a DHS infrastructure official said that, yes, the devices were ubiquitous and a ""real and growing threat.""

I then discovered the answer to my last question: Was anything done six years ago when cruder variants of the things were originally found?

An intelligence community consultant told me that the FBI and the NSA worked together to figure out who had placed the devices, first, by covertly installing diversionary loops on the transmitters, which would, I was told, give clues about where the signals were being diverted. Was there some sort of microwave mechanism that was directing them to the Israeli, the Chinese, or the Russian embassies? (Each of those countries have signals intelligence vaults in their D.C. embassies, just like the NSA and CIA have their ""Special Collection Services"" hiding in embassies and other places across the world.)

The FBI also began covert physical surveillance on some of the devices they found. Inevitably, if they were valuable collection tools, the cell site emulators would need maintenance or service. Collecting on the collection of foreign intelligence services, something only the FBI is allowed to do inside the United States, would allow the intelligence community to build a picture of potential targets and to harden them. This is basic SIGDEV — Signals Development — and has been a staple of the spy world since the signals intelligence revolution in World War II.

The official said that the foreign intelligence services used a flaw in the information exchange system that cellphone companies used to share metadata with each other. The flaws were built into the maw by a result of a mismatch between the transferring software and hardware on the one hand, and the ramshackle and highly interdependent architecture of the system on the other.

In 2011 and 2012, communications techs called that protocol ""Signaling System 7."" It was in use throughout the world. The NSA, in fact, exploited its vulnerability to intercept cellphone calls in foreign capitals. This exploitation capability was a tightly wrapped secret seven years ago. It was the primary technology, in fact, that the NSA used to identify and track the cellphones of foreign leaders. Many carriers have moved away from the protocol but, so far as I am aware, the SS7 security flaws are still used by intelligence services to monitor cellphones remotely.

The government won't say today what the status of its investigations are, and I can think of a number of reasons why. For one thing, I'm sure the FBI uses all the same exploitation technology to collect against foreign intelligence operatives inside Washington, D.C.

But that sort of counterintelligence collection raises a legal question. Let's say that, in the course of gathering the ""full take"" inside the U.S., some foreign intelligence agency unwittingly blurped up because their covert communications capacities were compromised. And let's say that virtually every conversation was wholly domestic — that is, the caller was a U.S. citizen and the recipient was a U.S. citizen. It's a reasonable assumption. But it also means that the FBI can't legally listen to the call, especially if they have a reason to believe it's entirely domestic. A FISA order would be required on one of the subjects at a minimum. It is not clear how the NSA and the FBI treat the content that they wittingly intercept from unwitting foreign intelligence services operating in the United States. We don't know. The agencies won't say.

Legally, the FBI would not even be able to store the content of conversations that American citizens had on cellphones that were either trapped by foreign intelligence services unless it helped them identify some other flaw in the arcane area of national security communication protocols. In the same way, the NSA contends that it can collect certain encrypted messages if it believes that the encryption was enabled for the purposes of defeating intelligence and national security equities.

Seeing just one part of the picture instantiates a natural curiosity to want to know more. Police use of Stingray devices is a problem we know about. But the extent of intelligence and counterintelligence exploitation of the same devices in Washington, D.C., are opaque. And since the government now admits that lots of sensitive data is being swept up by rogue actors inside the United States, we need to demand more answers."	-15.18
"Hey, you! Yes, you over there, with the teacup poodle hidden in your purse. Yes, I know she's in there, because last time I checked, Kate Spade didn't bark. Please come here. There's something you need to hear.

And don't look so smug, Mister Dog Hater Who Keeps Shooting Dirty Looks at the Perfectly Legitimate Service Dog. Sit down a spell. There's plenty of room, far away from the animal, for your own much-needed dose of empathy and common sense.

Actually, while we're at it? I think we all need to have a little chat about dogs, public spaces, and the nexus between the two before there are any more vicious fights. (And I'm not talking about the dogs.)

Over the past couple of years, I've noticed a decided uptick in the number of pooches accompanying people outside of the home: Maltese in the mall, Rotties in restaurants, and Labs on planes. Surely you've noticed it too.

This is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, under the right circumstances, human-dog interaction can be hugely beneficial to both species. Alexandra Horowitz, a cognitive scientist and the author of several books, including New York Times beststellers Inside of a Dog and Being a Dog, makes a good case.

""Dogs have been living with humans for thousands of years,"" she says. ""(Like humans), dogs are social animals, and need to be around other people or dogs — or both — depending on the dog. To leave them alone all day is to neglect this.

""Having dogs with their owners is a great idea for the dogs. Owners (and many other people) love it too.""

Horowitz hits on an important point: Canis lupus familiaris represents humans' first, wildly successful foray into genetic engineering. Today's domesticated dogs are the descendants of wild canids selectively bred over millennia to provide people with work and companionship. Recent research supports the physical, psychological, and emotional benefits many humans gain from the presence of dogs. At the same time, dogs need us, too.

""Many working dogs I've met seem highly fulfilled by having what we call 'work,' but what I think of really as an organization of their life,"" Horowitz says. ""Dogs, since domestication, have been relieved of the pressures of predation, finding food, finding shelter, and so forth — but what are they to do? Many pet dogs wind up being entirely under-stimulated because they have nothing to do.""

It can thus be argued that the human-dog relationship is a deeply symbiotic one, and is well celebrated by having our dogs with us all the time, everywhere we go.

Not so fast. The fact is, not everyone likes dogs. Many humans have an aversion to or fear of dogs. For them, forced proximity to other people's pets can be deeply distressing. And for those with allergies to canines? A close encounter of the doggy kind can cause severe physical discomfort ... even grave illness.

""Not everyone wants to meet a dog,"" Horowitz says, ""and people who bring their dogs out must be sensitive to that: If a stranger has no choice but to interact with your dog, that's a poor choice of place to bring the dog.""

Similarly, not all dogs like strange people, other dogs, or even certain places.

""There are plenty of places a dog might not want to go with you,"" says Horowitz. ""Depending on the dog, that might be someplace loud, distracting, new.""

There are other considerations. For all the reasons animal companions can be a boon in the workplace, they can also be a major distraction. Some perfectly normal canine quirks of behavior are unacceptable in some human settings. (Anyone who's ever been unwillingly herded by an off-leash shepherd dog or had his leg humped by an amorous terrier can attest to this.)

Last but not least, there are places where it is simply illegal to bring an animal of any sort, such as restaurants and groceries stores. According to individual states' interpretations of these federal laws, all dogs except highly trained dogs (and the occasional miniature horse) in service to Americans with disabilities may be excluded from both public and private property at the discretion of owners and operators.

Now, on the subject of legitimate service animals: Even the most curmudgeonly of dog-haters would agree that people with disabilities need their working dogs to assist them through a world not adapted to special needs; to perform basic functions of living ... sometimes even just to stay alive. Other folks benefit greatly from lesser-trained companions called ""emotional support animals""; however, at present, these ""ESA""s do not enjoy the same federal protections against public exclusion afforded by law to full service dogs and horses. Across the country, different states and municipalities are considering individual regulations for ESAs, but for the time being, national law does not recognize the right of any citizen to claim unrestricted access to public spaces for such an animal. Fortunately, most people with legitimate ESAs have chosen companions with temperaments and training to be sociable and undisruptive in public, and these helpful pooches rarely cause conflict between humans.

The trouble begins when people outside the gray area occupied by ESAs — people who just like their pets and want to take them everywhere — start co-opting the same privilege by ""registering"" their pets on bogus, unregulated websites and putting their untrained animals into similarly unregulated service vests. These dogs, without the temperament and painstaking training of legitimate support animals, are often the cause of public conflict, even causing many businesses to reform policy altogether. This hurts everyone.

So there we have it. Courtesy, common sense, and the law all dictate we stop thinking selfishly and start treating others — human and canine alike — with empathy, respect, and a simple dose of common sense.

So pull the dog out of the purse, and give a little room to the guy with the real service dog."	-15.18
"No actors have a perfect track record. It just isn't in the nature of a profession that involves so much collaboration and, ideally, risk-taking. Given that, Amy Adams has one of the most impressive filmographies around. Though not every movie she's made since her 2005 breakthrough Junebug has been a winner, a list of her best work is as long, strong, and varied as any performer of her generation. Movies like The Master, American Hustle, The Fighter, Talladega Nights, Big Eyes, Her, The Muppets, and Doubt are her rule, not occasional exceptions. She's the rare actor who can amass six Oscar nominations and still have a substantial list of shoulda-been-nominated parts (how was she overlooked for Arrival?).

She's also the rare actor who's been nominated for six Oscars without winning. In her new movie Hillbilly Elegy, she's in good company; Adams appears opposite Glenn Close, who has a similar seven-nomination streak without a win. Ultimately, this shouldn't matter. Both Close and Adams have already assured their respective legacies. Unfortunately, no one seems to have told Hillbilly Elegy this. It seems custom-designed to win one or both of them an Oscar, and makes everyone involved look worse in the process.

The requisite awards-chasing de-glamming is in effect here, ignoring how often Adams has been willing to downplay her beauty in more subtle ways in the past. No matter: Bev, the Kentucky-to-Ohio transplant she plays in this adaptation of J.D. Vance's bestselling memoir, goes further, wearing her extra-long hair with bangs and acid-wash well into the late '90s, where about half the story takes place. She's the troubled mom of J.D. (Owen Asztalos as a kid; Gabriel Basso as an adult), struggling to make ends meet for her single-parent household and descending into addiction. Close plays Mamaw, Bev's mom, who lives in similarly dire circumstances and fights to keep her grandson on the right path.

Adams is the only actor billed above the title, and she has lots of big scenes. Actually, she has almost nothing but big scenes: Bev explodes with rage, roller-skates down a hospital hallway while high (and on the clock as a nurse), begs for help, angrily refuses help, and explodes with rage again. For most of her screen time, she's playing an addict, and Hillbilly Elegy has an addict's desperation, clawing for a fix of showy breakdowns. If a scene doesn't end with a physical confrontation and/or the cops showing up, the movie seems to ask, does it really count as acting?

Hillbilly Elegy can't really be blamed on Adams, or any of its actors. It can't even be entirely blamed on the screenplay's weirdly agnostic, myopic ideas about American poverty, addiction, and hopelessness. On a level of pure craft, the movie is shockingly inept, reducing its narrative to a series of barely-contextualized sequences of amped-up melodrama. Director Ron Howard cuts between J.D. growing up in Ohio and dealing with a family crisis years later as he attempts to fit in at Yale Law, and key information seems to get lost in the endless back-and-forth. Adams gives the rawest performance in the movie —Close, for her part, does a lot of makeup-enabled mugging — and rather than conveying emotional directness, her rawness comes across as uncooked. Her usual conviction and sensitivity are no match for the fact that Bev's problems are so clearly and frequently verbalized. Adams doesn't have space to utilize the quieter, more reactive style she's perfected elsewhere. The movie has no use for it.

It's the neediness of Hillbilly Elegy that sets it apart from other Adams performances, even in her less successful films. Many of her characters have a certain scrappy optimism that could have played well in the Hollywood of the '40s or the '50s; she's fine as Lois Lane in Zack Snyder's aborted Superman series, but would have been better in a period-piece version (or at least a movie that cared more about Lois). She's done screwball-ish comedy (as in the underseen Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day) and even played a Disney princess made flesh (as in Enchanted), with a clear understanding of the conflict and self-doubt brewing beneath a bubbly surface. Yet for all her ebullience, she doesn't often go big. In the wild acting competition of American Hustle, she's the quietest and least showy of the four leads, even with her fake British accent and ostentatious cons. For smaller parts in Her and Vice, she doesn't aspire to steal scenes. It's her ability to hold our attention while simply thinking that makes her center-stage work in Arrival so compelling.

This all makes her performance in Hillbilly Elegy stand out even more, and not in a good way. Moment to moment, nothing in the movie feels out of her considerable range. Taken together, her work plays like a series of awards-show clips. No judgments if she really does want that Oscar; she's been deserving many times over the course of her career. But she's so deftly avoided bad material for so long that seeing her vamp through this mess is particularly jarring. It's a grim reminder of how Hollywood sees middle-aged women primarily as moms, awards bait, and possible stars of prestige TV. As embarrassing as it would be for Hillbilly Elegy to win anyone an Oscar, maybe that's the best-case scenario: Adams gets her long-overdue award and gets to keep indulging her exceptional talent and taste."	-15.18
"Americans really don't like President Trump, who desperately wants to be liked by Americans.

A new poll by The New York Times and Siena College shows him trailing Joe Biden nationally by 14 points, 50 percent to 36 percent. Biden leads among women and nonwhite voters and is gaining ground among white voters. It's possible that Biden leads among former members of the Trump administration, too.

Majorities disapprove of Trump's handling of the pandemic, his handling of the protests following the death of George Floyd, and his handling of race relations in general.

There's good news for Trump, sort of. He leads Biden by 19 points among white voters with no college education (a group he won by 36 points in 2016). The more white and the less educated you are, the more likely you are to support Trump, who on Sunday defended Confederate statues because they are ""history"" and who on Monday misspelled the word ""history.""

Trump has never been popular in office. He's the first president never to attain an approval rating of 50 percent in any credible poll. He won the 2016 election with only 46 percent of the popular vote. That's 10 points more than where he is now.

Republicans are criticizing Biden for ""hiding in his basement."" This is a compliment masquerading as a criticism. That Biden is staying at home during a pandemic is a testament to his deference to public health and his political savvy. Biden knows that no one makes a stronger case against Trump than Trump himself.

In the span of 24 hours this week, the president accused his predecessor of treason, accused Democrats of rigging the election, called his former national security adviser ""a lowlife who should be in jail,"" said we'd have fewer COVID cases if we had fewer tests, posted a racist video, and misspelled ""history"" and ""shame."" It was a shameful day in presidential history and a typical day in Trump's presidency.

In Trump we have a president in which incompetence, stupidity, derangement, bigotry, corruption, and dishonesty are each struggling to take the upper hand.

Americans have strong feelings about Trump. Twenty-seven percent of voters view him very favorably; 50 percent view him very unfavorably. Few people are passionate about Biden, which is a good sign. The only way to defeat a personality cult democratically is by replacing it with a personality that doesn't inspire a cult.

Running as an incumbent is different from running as an outsider. Instead of playing on people's grievances, Trump has to placate their anxieties. Instead of saying how awful everything is without him as president, he has to pretend that things are wonderful now that he is. It's hard to pretend that a pandemic and the worst recession since World War II are wonderful.

Trump's challenge as a non-challenger is to talk about anything other than his record. At his rally in Tulsa last weekend, he spent nearly 15 minutes talking about his ability to walk down a ramp and to sip water with one hand. This week — as seven states reported their highest numbers of coronavirus hospitalizations and as 1.5 million Americans filed for unemployment — Trump said the lobster industry was ""back, bigger and better than anyone thought possible.""

Trump isn't talking about the issues that matter most. He's talking about lobsters, ""Obamagate,"" flag burning, and Confederate monuments because he doesn't want — can't afford — to talk about three crises: the health crisis, the economic crisis, and his presidency.

With nothing to brag about, he is spouting Nixonian catchphrases about ""THE SILENT MAJORITY,"" notwithstanding the fact that his base is neither silent nor the majority. Trump seems to think that by saying or tweeting something, his words will become actualized — that if he says his supporters are the majority, that means they are. Instead of persuading people to support him, Trump is deceiving himself into believing they already do.

To many voters in 2016, the idea of an outsider ""shaking things up"" was vaguely appealing, precisely because it was so vague. As a political neophyte, Trump could make sweeping promises without having to defend or explain anything. His inexperience was a boon. Having never been tested in politics, he had never failed. He talked like a regular guy, which is to say, like someone who had no idea what he was talking about. He still talks that way.

Now we know the consequences of a Trump presidency: mass death, mass unemployment, civil unrest, an erosion of democratic norms at home, and growing distrust of America abroad. Trump may not learn from experience, but voters do."	-15.18
"President Trump loves books about himself and hates books about himself. If you write a book praising him, he will respond by not reading it and praising it. If you write a book criticizing him, he will respond by not reading it, condemning it and you, and possibly trying to ban it and prosecute you.

This is how he has responded to his former National Security Adviser John Bolton's new memoir, The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir, which comes out next Tuesday. Trump called Bolton a ""traitor,"" a ""liar,"" ""Wacko John Bolton,"" ""incompetent,"" a ""sick puppy,"" a ""disgruntled boring fool,"" and ""a dope,"" but neglected to call him someone he hired. Trump called Bolton's book ""a compilation of lies and made up stories, all intended to make me look bad"" and ""pure fiction,"" which prompts the question: Why does the president want to ban a work of pure fiction and criminally prosecute its author?

In a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, the Justice Department said Bolton's book ""contains classified information"" and ""will damage the national security of the United States."" The president, meanwhile, said he considers ""every conversation with me as president highly classified."" Presumably, this includes his perfect conversations with world leaders, one of which he released last year, thereby damaging the national security of the United States. The Justice Department should look into that.

According to excerpts of Bolton's memoir published by the Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, Trump thought Finland was part of Russia, didn't know Britain has nuclear weapons, talks about himself rather than listens during intelligence briefings, thought it would be ""cool"" to invade Venezuela, expressed a desire to execute journalists, supported China's concentration camps, and sought its government's help in getting himself re-elected by orienting trade negotiations for his own political benefit.

These revelations elicit a dual response: ""Holy sh--!"" and ""This does not surprise me at all."" Reading the excerpts, we learn new details about what we already know: Trump doesn't know what he's doing, but he's doing it for himself. New facts about Trump confirm old truths about him, namely that he shouldn't be president.

In terms of effecting political change, Bolton's book will be as inconsequential as the United Nations resolutions he made a career out of deploring. The few Republican lawmakers who read it will pretend they didn't, out of fear of offending Trump.

In addition to making Bolton $2 million richer, the book will make more people hate him than already do. Trump's critics abhor Bolton for not testifying in the House's impeachment inquiry when he had the chance. Trump's supporters are attacking Bolton because Trump is attacking him, and Trump is attacking Bolton because Bolton is, one presumes, telling the truth about him. That is the worst thing you can do to him.

Anyone who tells the truth about the president can expect massive publicity, most of it coming from the president himself. Trump's attacks have made Bolton's book a No. 1 bestseller on Amazon. Last month, the Lincoln Project's ""Mourning in America"" ad went from a must-see video to an impossible-not-to-see video after the president tweeted about the group. (I bring this up both because it's a good example and because I am a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project and want the publicity of a cyber-attack from the president, @realDonaldTrump, who can reach me, @WindsorMann, on Twitter.)

Because I don't have an advance copy of Bolton's book, I don't know if it's worth reading, but it was definitely worth writing. Everyone who has a story to tell about this president should tell it, so long as it's true. We're better off knowing more, regardless of whether Bolton is financially better off.

The only benefit to working in the Trump administration is that you can write a tell-all memoir after you leave. Your real service to the country can begin when your service to Trump ends. Please, by all means, tell all.

"First Cow opens with lovely poetry from William Blake: ""The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship."" The line precedes the film's opening sequence, where an unnamed woman (Alia Shawkat) and her dog (because what would a Kelly Reichardt production be without a dog?) stumble upon and unearth a pair of human skeletons buried a stone's throw from a rivershore in modern day Oregon. Blake's words take on dual meaning: Friendship might be home and hearth for man, but it's also his tomb.

Given that the bones belong to 1800s frontiersmen who'd rather be anywhere than the frontier, the implications of the contrast feel more tender than they do morbid. Deducing whose remains the woman has found in the film's present is a simple task. It's the questions of how they got there, and why, that Reichardt refuses to answer upfront.

One of the dead men is Cookie (John Magaro), so named because he's a cook and his companions, a troupe of uncivilized fur trappers, lack imagination. The other is King Lu (Orion Lee), a Chinese expat on the lam from a pack of Russian thugs. Neither King Lu nor Cookie care for the casual barbarity of their time and place; they get along easily and form an immediate bond. Then they conspire to steal milk from a cow (the first cow, in fact) owned by a wealthy Brit by the name of Chief Factor (Toby Jones), use said milk to bake tasty goods, and make a mint selling their treats to hungry and homesick pioneers (as well as the wealthy Brit, a pompous naif who's none the wiser to their theft).

The picture that First Cow most closely mirrors is one of Reichardt's own: Old Joy, her adaptation of a Jonathan Raymond short story that orbits two men whose friendship has rusted over through the passage of years. Unlike Old Joy's long-time pals, Cookie and King Lu are new acquaintances who become fast friends. But just like Old Joy, First Cow explores the hushed melancholy of platonic male friendship. Reichardt's historical lens gives that melancholy new context: Cookie and King gravitate toward each other out of what looks like necessity at first, but as the film progresses, ""need"" takes on expansive, more tender meaning.

Reichardt is blunt in her portraiture of the era and the environment; frontier Oregon is unforgiving, populated by men so far removed from polite society for so long a time that they act more like ogres. Bar fights are started seemingly as a way to pass the time, if not for the fighters than for other patrons, who eagerly rush outside to see who wins. (One fighter leaves his baby, snug in a basket, sitting on the bartop under Cookie's reluctant custody.) First Cow wastes no time impressing on the audience that King Lu and Cookie don't fit in among rugged landscapes and rough men: They're more likely to fit in, say, around San Francisco, a city King Lu always holds close in his mind, or maybe Boston, where Cookie learned how to bake like a master.

King Lu keeps his brain's gears well-greased at all times, cooking up business plans and commercial opportunities faster than Cookie can whip up his ""oily cakes,"" the confection the two hawk to their burgeoning clientele. When they're alone, King Lu does the talking while Cookie quietly, contentedly, does the baking. On the surface, their relationship is a matter of convenience: Cookie has a commodity people will buy, King Lu has a talent for selling commodities. But both of them share a common desire for more, or if not more, then certainly better than what they currently have. Magaro lends Cookie a wistfulness, a humble sort of longing, that compliments Lee's outspoken performance: Together they define Cookie and King Lu not as fated business partners but as spiritual kin. They meet not because they're well-suited as colleagues, but because they're soulmates.

Reichardt's chosen her moment for revisiting Old Joy's themes well. First Cow feels like a valuable lesson in male intimacy, a movie about the ease with which men can maintain close attachments to one another sans shame. There's no big, staged scene where Cookie and King Lu profess their mutual love, but that's for the best: The love they share speaks for itself. After treading through wilderness and fleeing from harm, they're able to enjoy peaceful domesticity, isolated from the period's harsh realities. When Cookie arrives at the camp with the trappers, one particularly brutal-looking man gives him a menacing send-off, his gaze scraping over Cookie as he makes violent promises should their paths cross again. Cookie scampers off at his first opportunity. Their paths never cross again; he makes sure of it.

First Cow shows viewers a glimpse at what manhood looked like two centuries ago, when men were expected to be tough and those who weren't were prey and sport for the rest. Today the world still worships the strongman: Jair Balsonaro, Rodrigo Duterte, Donald Trump, Matteo Salvini, Xi Jinping, each toxic in his own way and also in the same ways as his peers. And toxicity trickles down throughout the rest of culture, too, such that any non-toxic male characters feel like rare gifts. What First Cow offers — a vision not only of non-toxic male characters, but non-toxic male characters with an abiding emotional connection — feels rarer still, and wholly vital. The message isn't that it's okay for men to be friends; it's that it's okay for male friendship to have deep roots that last and that endure beyond the span of years and decades.

The tragedy of Cookie and King Lu's end, in that regard, isn't tragic at all: haunting, sure, but also painfully beautiful. We all deserve something sweet in life. For most, that's an oily cake. For Cookie and King Lu, it's a friendship that they take to the grave.

"In his 1868 novel Norwood, or Village Life in New England, clergyman, abolitionist, and social reformer Henry Ward Beecher opines that ""every artist dips his brush in his own soul and paints his own nature into his pictures."" A century and a half later, French filmmaker Céline Sciamma's latest, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, incidentally dramatizes this dynamic through rigorous demonstrations of portraiture: The movie focuses on two women falling in love with each other in the late 1700s, one an aristocrat, the other an artist commissioned to capture her likeness on canvas.

Marianne (Noémie Merlant) arrives at an island castle off the coast of Brittany, soaked to the bone but no worse for wear, ready to start painting her subject, Héloïse (Adèle Haenel); the portrait is intended as a gift to Héloïse's betrothed, a Milanese nobleman who wants to know what she looks like before he commits. (Think of it as an 18th-century dating app, only much worse.) Héloïse, being strong in spirit and intolerant of suffocating misogynist baloney, has already sent the previous portrait artist packing by refusing to pose for them, so at the behest of her mother, the Countess, (Valeria Golino), Marianne plays a hired companion, palling around with Héloïse by the sea, getting existential and philosophical as the French are wont to do.

By day, Marianne watches Héloïse. By night, she paints. Sciamma's camera cuts back and forth between Merlant's face and the canvas, where the audience sees the slowly blossoming fruits of her labor. (They also see hands belonging not to Merlant but Hélène Delmaire, the French artist who shouldered the Herculean task of painting 14 versions of Héloïse's portrait as Sciamma's cinematographer, Claire Mathon, breathed down her neck.) Eventually, Marianne completes Héloïse's portrait, and they part ways under heart-wrenching circumstances. But considering that the movie has the word ""portrait"" in the title, finishing the portrait feels besides the point.

Portrait of a Lady on Fire's central feature is its love story, which is as much a story of gender politics, life as a woman under patriarchal rule, queer identity, and what it's like to truly see, and be seen by, another person as it is a visual lesson on the artist's process. Frankly, the latter is in many ways more important than the former elements; without it, the audience has less reason to appreciate the amour. Marianne thinks she can simply paint Héloïse, that all she'll need to do is observe and report, and that this is enough to reflect Héloïse's essence. For the Milanese suitor, maybe it would've been. For Marianne and for Héloïse, it's inadequate. ""Is that me?"" Héloïse archly inquires when she lays eyes on Marianne's work, about an hour into the film. ""Is that how you see me?""

""It's not only me,"" Marianne replies. It's how the ""rules, conventions, and ideas"" that comprise the painter's discipline see Héloïse, in other words, Héloïse means that there's neither life nor presence in the work. Marianne, at this moment, has little to go on but her eyes and education to aid her in Héloïse's portrait; instead, she has to paint what she knows, and what she knows, as the audience clearly sees through sequences of Delmaire painting before Mathon's lens, is what she's been taught. Their exchange rapidly grows heated. ""The fact it isn't close to me, that I can understand. But I find it sad it isn't close to you,"" says Héloïse, and Marianne's nostrils flare: ""How do you know it isn't close to me? I didn't know you were an art critic.""

Heloise's retort is far cooler: ""I didn't know you were a painter.""

Sciamma's dialogue, coupled with Merlant and Haenel's performances, would probably pop just as well sans the interstitial painting sequences, but they'd lack grounding. The trouble with turning a person into art is that all the training in the world can't help the artist snare the ineffable something that makes a person fascinating enough to paint to begin with; the work that goes into each brushstroke can easily be for naught without a firm grip on the subject's persona. Marianne's technique is impressive. We see it in each scrape of her charcoal as she traces Héloïse's contours on paper, and every crosshatch brush stroke she takes to recreate the vivid green hue of Héloïse's dress. These moments are filmed gently, but with Marianne's determination bursting around the edges of the frame. Visually, they're relaxing. Practically, they're demanding.

The more we see Marianne's (actually Delmaire's) technique in progress, the deeper she falls in love with Héloïse, so it's little wonder that after their prickly back and forth over the first portrait, Marianne mars it, much to the Countess' displeasure. But Marianne's gesture means so much to Héloïse that she agrees to pose for a second painting, and the work begins afresh, this time with more vigor, more passion — and more communication, too. ""I can't make you smile,"" Marianne tells Héloïse during one of their sessions. ""I feel I do, and then it vanishes."" ""Anger always comes to the fore,"" Héloïse says soothingly, as if in apology. ""Definitely with you,"" Marianne quips back. Now that Héloïse knows she's being painted, Marianne no longer has to maintain a facade; now that she no longer has to maintain a facade, she's free to be playful.

Her freedom shows in her aesthetics. Practiced eyes are needed to tell if Delmaire does anything noticeably different when she paints in the second half of Portrait of a Lady on Fire compared to its first, but in the film, the final finished portrait speaks for itself — so much so that Sciamma doesn't show her viewer right away, and instead gives Marianne and Héloïse the first look. They both stare at it wearing their best poker faces, satisfied but also disinterested. Drawing and painting Héloïse led Marianne to see her; seeing her led Marianne to fall in love with her. Witnessing the act of artistic creation lets the film's audience appreciate the connection between love, desire, and especially memory.

Portrait of a Lady on Fire is presented from its opening sequence as a recollection, set in the movie's present day as Marianne instructs a classroom of young women to paint her. ""Take time to look at me,"" she tells her students. Marianne by now knows well that portraiture is an investment in the subject; her experiences with Héloïse taught her as much. That investment is made through the marks on the canvas, through splashes of paint and pencil scratches, and Sciamma's emphasis on the method is essential for the development of 2019's most passionate on-screen romance.

"We yell, we fight, we argue, all in pursuit of a nebulous goal. Fires burn everywhere, insults are hurled across the room, and friendships are splintered.

I'm not talking about any political debates or misguided rallies. I'm talking about playing Overcooked 2.

The latest cooking simulation video game from Ghost Town Games, Overcooked 2 is the sequel to, what else, Overcooked, a charming little restaurant role-playing game on the surface that's hiding a brutally unforgiving teamwork seminar beneath. In both games, you play as a cartoon chef with one thing in mind: making as many meals as possible in a short amount of time. You do this by grilling meat, plating buns, chopping vegetables, and throwing them into a Hungry Hungry Hippo of a conveyor belt, which is always looking for the next dish on the list. As you throw perfect dishes down on the belt, you accumulate points. When you hit the three-star threshold, you move on to the next stage.

Of course, it would be too easy if all you had to do was organize ingredients. Overcooked's ingenious twist on your local Michelin star kitchen is that the stages all bring their own truly absurd obstacles. On some levels, you'll be stationed on a pirate ship that rocks back and forth, the layout of the kitchen changing with each shift. On others, you'll be stuck on hot air balloons that separate the grill from the ingredients from the dishwasher — because, oh yeah, you have to wash your dishes too, you filthy animal.

Where Overcooked mostly hinged on its increasingly complex stages, Overcooked 2, which came out last week, amps up the ridiculousness with new stages and new recipes. Cakes, sushi, salads, and other complex creations feature on the new game's list, throwing off even the most seasoned chefs of the original game and deftly increasing the replayability factor for the new installment.

While you can play all of the Overcooked series solo, the real fun comes when you drag friends into the kitchen with you. With Overcooked, this had to be couch co-op, but Ghost Town smartly took things a step further with the sequel, giving players the option to chef it up online. With Overcooked 2, you can yell at your friend for burning your hamburger meat from clear across the country. (And yell you will. If nothing else, Overcooked 2 should be the loudest online cooperative game since Halo 2 on Legendary difficulty.)

Hiding beneath a competitive exterior and seemingly capitalist ideologies, however, lies a warm and communal game that should strengthen your bonds with your partners in cooking. No one is more important than anyone else in the Overcooked kitchen; sure, you'll likely go further if you designate a head chef to manage the assembly line, but that person also has to wade into the muck and wash some dishes. In fact, you might want to intentionally give your ""leader"" the most mindless tasks so that they have the bandwidth for managing the process, and let your skilled workers shine elsewhere.

Overcooked as a series shines because it removes the ego from a player and gives it to the team; it makes its main issue not competition but cooperation. It's what would happen if, all of a sudden, someone flipped a switch and the United States became a socialist country. How would you react to losing your ability to rack up points? Would you sulk at being given the task of tomato chopper, or would you make sure that your team gets to three stars anyway, armed with your watchful eye and potent knife?

That's the challenge at the heart of Overcooked — and one that Ghost Town has contextualized without beating you over the head with the message. Unity isn't just a goal in the kitchens here; it's the basic instinct, the prime directive.

That's not to say that you'll pin a rose to your lapel if you spend the 10 or so hours it takes to beat the main story of Overcooked 2. But there have been countless stories already about friends growing closer while playing the game, bridging the social gaps that come with life in 2018. As media further segments into left and right, to have a video game where the only individual flair is which chef you want to play as feels revolutionary.

Overcooked was a massive success because it understood that playing as a unit is significantly more enjoyable than trying to rack up kill counts or goals scored or arbitrary point totals alone. The only points that matter are the ones your team amasses together, and even those are only a fun side objective; the real enjoyment comes from not how many three-star ratings you get, but rather from reminiscing with your buddies about that time you beat the pirate-ship level with just seconds to go.

That nostalgia factor has been lost somewhat in modern gaming. We don't remember individual Call of Duty games because they're mostly played in the grind for a new prestige level. We don't remember one game in FIFA Ultimate Team, because it's one of hundreds logged on the way to Division 1. We complain a lot in those games, too, because any imperfections in the product can set us behind our peers.

Overcooked has its share of buggy patches and unfair levels. But you're not truly competing with anyone, so it doesn't really matter. You and your squad are just trying to be the best chefs you can be. And because each stage is so distinct from the others, you remember the time when, say, your best friend perfectly lobbed a piece of fish across a fiery chasm, enabling you to assemble the last sushi roll you needed to get your team that three-star rating.

It's nice to take a breather from an increasingly isolated society to work together with no ulterior motive except team success. And so, while metaphorical fires rage in the outside world, the only fires in Overcooked 2 are literal kitchen fires, and you can solve those pretty easily ... that is, if your buddy would GET OFF HIS LAZY BUTT AND USE THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER ALREADY."	-15.18
"Throughout each of its four films, The Purge has made one message very clear: White men in power will do anything to maintain it.

To that end: The government's New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) party, tired of co-existing with disenfranchised, mostly-minority poor people, has instituted an annual holiday, grossly called Purge Night. The holiday, on which vicious murder is not only legal but encouraged, allows the mostly white men of the NFFA to maintain their lock on power.

The politics of this wildly dystopian universe, which highlight unsettling truths about the way white supremacy enables abusive behavior, have been persistent in each installment: The Purge; The Purge: Anarchy; The Purge: Election Year; and this summer's prequel, The First Purge. We see seemingly upstanding citizens, most of whom are powerful white men or those incentivized by a white government, turn into the most abominable versions of themselves as they terrorize oppressed people of color, triggered by a rage they've been given the right to indulge in. It's become an event complete with horrifying masks, machetes, machine guns, armored trucks, and celebratory gore.

But the eponymous TV adaptation, which premiered Sept. 4, flips that script. Rather than focusing on violence by white citizens, this time around one of the killers is a black woman, whose rage is just as lethal as her white counterparts' — and it's aimed directly at everything they represent.

When we first meet Jane (Amanda Warren) in the pilot episode of The Purge, she seems unsuspecting. She's successful by most standards, with a high-powered corporate job leading a large staff in what she considers one of the ""safest"" buildings in the city with one of the most expensive and dedicated security teams. She's so confident, in fact, that she chooses to forego a quiet evening at her home on Purge Night to work in the office with her team.

By the second episode, which aired Tuesday night with the title ""Take What's Yours,"" the layers of Jane's backstory are peeled away to reveal a long history of being marginalized at her company. She's constantly having to squirm away from her boss David's (William Baldwin) unwanted sexual advances, and she's been long overlooked for partner. Her talent is clear — even David says so — but the glass ceiling remains as low as ever for her, and she's understandably grown weary. After years of resisting David's persistent flirtation, watching him move on to younger, more eager white women employees willing to do whatever it takes to rise up the ranks hasn't made her experience at the company any more tolerable. She's tired — or, as civil rights heroine Fannie Lou Hamer once said, she's ""sick and tired of being sick and tired.""

So, this Purge Night, which will span for all of the series' 10 episodes, Jane has decided to take power back by force. Tonight, she plans to pay to have David murdered.

Jane has been harboring resentment for years, but as potentially the only black woman at her company, she can't express even justifiable frustration for fear of being labeled ""the angry black woman"" — a stereotype so many are forced to confront in the workplace. As a result, she's gone unheard and been left powerless in a corporate structure that was not built for her to succeed in the first place.

That's a lot to suppress for so many years, and the burden has clearly crushed much of Jane's mental and emotional state. It's brought her to the point where she is questioning her own morality and resorting to cold-blooded murder. She is taking control the only way she can, by inserting herself into a bloody political structure where she can for once end up the victor.

But Jane wrestles with her decision up until the time comes for her to hand the money off to her assassin, who's also a woman of color. Does having David murdered make her just as heinous as all the other purgers? Is this really the only way to alleviate the rage that's been building up inside of her for years? Jane contends with these questions aloud as she tries to explain to her hired assassin — whose name is intentionally undisclosed — in their first meeting that this is really her only choice. She starts rattling off longtime grievances at her job, finally daring to vocalize these issues in front of someone who might actually be able to commiserate.

Never mind that the assassin is far from interested — this is a business transaction, after all. For Jane, this is a time for her to validate what she is feeling, and at last give herself the permission to go against every principle she has stood on in order to confront white supremacy in its most anarchic state. Her morals are pushed aside in favor of a much greater, more sinister outcome. Notably, Jane's decision to have David murdered positions her, for the first time ever, on the same level as her white counterparts.

The Purge franchise has always had a knack for deconstructing humans' motivations for violence in an increasingly politically charged society. With this latest offering, the brand has gone a step further, highlighting the power disparity that exists when it comes to race and crystallizing how that can so easily lead to a person who's been sidelined for so long becoming completely unhinged. Through Jane's story, The Purge illuminates how this imbalance directly affects black women — and gives them the authority to finally manifest a rage they've long withheld, in a way that's frighteningly familiar to their white peers."	-15.18
